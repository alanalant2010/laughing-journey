 

Active ingredient: Buprenorphine Hydrochloride 

 

Form/Route: Tablet/Sublingual 

 

Recommended studies: 1 study 

 

1. Type of study: Fasting 


Design: Single-dose, two-way crossover in vivo 

Strength: EQ 8 mg base 

Subjects: Healthy males and nonpregnant females, general population 

Additional Comments: 

1. Tablets should be placed under the tongue until they are dissolved; swallowing 
the tablets reduces the bioavailability of the drug. 


 

2. A naltrexone blockade should be used to remove the risk of any opioid-related 
adverse events. Naltrexone should be administered well in advance of dosing to 
achieve adequate blockade of opioid receptors. The most common approach is to 
administer 50 mg of naltrexone at the following times: (1) 12 hours prior to 
dosing; (2) at the time of study drug dosing; and (3) 12 hours after the last dose of 
study drug. Please consult with a physician who is an expert in the administration 
of opioids for an appropriate dose of narcotic antagonist. 


 

3. Buprenorphine Hydrochloride Sublingual Tablet is currently listed in Risk 
Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program with Elements To Assure 
Safe Use (ETASU) (1) to mitigate the risks of accidental overdose, misuse and 
abuse and (2) inform patients of the serious risks associated with buprenorphine-
containing products. All pertinent elements of the REMS must be incorporated 
into the protocol and informed consent in the bioequivalence studies. 


________________________________________________________________________ 

 

Analytes to measure (in appropriate biological fluid): Buprenorphine and its active metabolite 
norbuprenorphine in plasma. 

 

Bioequivalence based on (90% CI): Buprenorphine 

 

Please submit the metabolite data as supportive evidence of comparable therapeutic outcome. 
For the metabolite, the following data should be submitted: individual and mean concentrations, 


individual and mean pharmacokinetic parameters, and geometric means and ratios of means forAUC and Cmax.

Waiver request of invivo testing:EQ2 mg base strengthbased on(i) acceptable 
bioequivalence study on the EQ 8 mg base strength, (ii) acceptable in vitro dissolution testing ofall strengths, and(iii) proportional similarity of the formulations across all strengths.Please referto the Mirtazapine Tablet Draft Guidance for additional information regarding waivers of in vivo 
testing.

Dissolution test method and sampling times:

Please note that a Dissolution Methods Databaseis available to the public at the OGDwebsiteathttp://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/dissolution/.Please find thedissolution 
information for this product at this website.Please conduct comparative dissolution testing on 12 
dosage units each of both strengths of the test and reference products.Specifications will bedetermined upon reviewof the application.
