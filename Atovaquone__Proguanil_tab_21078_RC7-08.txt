Please note that a Dissolution Methods Database is available to the public at the OGD website 
at http://www.fda.gov/cder/ogd/index.htm. Please find the dissolution information for this 
product at this website. Please conduct comparative dissolution testing on 12 dosage units each 
of all strengths of the test and reference products. Specifications will be determined upon review 
of the application.
