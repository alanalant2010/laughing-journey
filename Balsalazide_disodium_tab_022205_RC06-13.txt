Form/Route: Tablets/Oral 

 

Recommended studies: 2 studies 

 

1. Type of study: Fasting 

Design: Single-dose, two-treatment, two-period crossover in-vivo 

Strength: 1.1 g (dose = 3×1.1 g) 

Subjects: Healthy males and nonpregnant females, general population. 

Additional comments: Applicants may consider using a reference-scaled average 
bioequivalence approach for this drug product. If using this approach, the applicant 
should provide evidence of high variability in the bioequivalence parameters (i.e., within-
subject variability = 30%) for the reference product. For general information on this 
approach refer to the Progesterone Capsule Guidance for additional information 
regarding highly variable drugs.

Dissolution test method and sampling times: 

Please note that a Dissolution Methods Database is available to the public at the OGD website 
at http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/dissolution/. Please find the dissolution 
information for this product at this website. Please conduct comparative dissolution testing on 12 
dosage units each of all strengths of the test and reference products. Specifications will be 
determined upon review of the application.
