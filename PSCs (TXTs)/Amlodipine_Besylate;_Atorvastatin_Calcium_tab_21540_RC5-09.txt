Form/Route: Tablets/Oral 

 

Recommended studies: 2 studies 

 

1. Type of study: Fasting 
Design: Single-dose, two-way, crossover in-vivo 

Strength: Eq 10 mg base; Eq 80 mg base 

Subjects: Healthy males and nonpregnant females, general population. 

Additional Comments: Applicants may consider using a reference-scaled average bioequivalence 
approach for this drug product. If using this approach, the applicant should provide evidence of high 
variability in the bioequivalence parameters AUC and/or Cmax (i.e., within-subject variability > 
30%). For general information on this approach, please refer to Haidar et al., Bioequivalence 
Approaches for Highly Variable Drugs and Drug Products, Pharm. Res. 25:237-241(2008).

Analytes to measure: Amlodipine and atorvastatin in plasma 

 

Bioequivalence based on (90% CI): Amlodipine and atorvastatin. 

 

The active ortho- and para-hydroxylated metabolites of atorvastatin in plasma should be measured. 

Please submit the metabolite data as supportive evidence of comparable therapeutic outcome. For the 
metabolites, the following data should be submitted: individual and mean concentrations, individual and mean 
pharmacokinetic parameters, and geometric means and ratios of means for AUC and Cmax. 

 

Waiver request of in-vivo testing: 2.5 mg/10 mg, 2.5 mg/20 mg, 2.5 mg/40 mg, 5 mg/10 mg, 5 mg/20 mg, 5 
mg/40 mg, 5 mg/80 mg, 10 mg/10 mg, 10 mg/20 mg and 10 mg/40 mg based on (i) acceptable bioequivalence 
studies on the Eq 10 mg base; Eq 80 mg base strength, (ii) acceptable dissolution testing across all strengths, 
and (iii) proportional similarity in the formulations across all strengths. 

 

Dissolution test method and sampling times: 

 

Please note that a Dissolution Methods Database is available to the public at the OGD website at 
http://www.fda.gov/cder/ogd/index.htm. Please find the dissolution information for this product at this 
website. Please conduct comparative dissolution testing on 12 dosage units each of all strengths of the test and 
reference products. Specifications will be determined upon review of the application.
