Recommended studies: 2 studies 

 

1. Type of study: Fasting 
Design: Single-dose, two-way crossover in-vivo 

Strength: 1 mg 

Subjects: Please conduct the studies in post-menopausal subjects or surgically sterile 
females. 

 Additional Comments: Please do not include subjects who are using female hormone 
replacement therapies, thyroid hormone replacement therapies, or antihypertensive 
therapies in the study population. 




 Anastrozole has a long terminal elimination half-life. Please ensure adequate 
washout periods between treatments in the crossover studies. You may also consider 
using a parallel study design due to anastrozole’s long half-life. For long half-life drug 
products, an AUC truncated to 72 hours may be used in place of AUC0-t or AUC0-8. 
Please collect sufficient blood samples in the bioequivalence studies to adequately 
characterize the peak concentration (Cmax) and time to reach peak concentration (tmax).
