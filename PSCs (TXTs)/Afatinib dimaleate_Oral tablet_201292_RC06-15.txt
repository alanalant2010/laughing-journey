the formulations across all strengths, and (iii) acceptable in vitro dissolution testing of all 
strengths. 

 

Dissolution test method and sampling times: The dissolution information for this drug 
product can be found on the FDA-Recommended Dissolution Methods Web site, available to the 
public at the following location: http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/dissolution/. 
Conduct comparative dissolution testing on 12 dosage units each of all flavors of the test and 
reference products. Specifications will be determined upon review of the abbreviated new drug
