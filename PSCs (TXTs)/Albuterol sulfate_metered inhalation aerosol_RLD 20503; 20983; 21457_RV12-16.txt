Dosage Form; Route: Aerosol, metered; inhalation 

 

Strength: EQ 0.09 mg BASE/INH 

 

Recommended Studies: In vitro and in vivo studies 

 

The following in vitro and in vivo studies are recommended to establish bioequivalence (BE) of 
the test (T) and reference (R) metered dose inhalers (MDIs) containing albuterol sulfate. 

______________________________________________________________________________ 

 

In Vitro Studies 

 

FDA recommends that applicants conduct the following in vitro studies using at least three 
batches each of T and R products, with no fewer than 10 units from each batch. The three 
batches of T product should be manufactured from, at minimum, three different batches of drug 
substance(s), excipient(s), and container/closure system. 

 

1. Type of study: Single actuation content (SAC) 


Design: The SAC test should be performed at the beginning (B), middle (M), and end (E) 
lifestages1 of the product using a flow rate of 28.3 L/min. The USP <601> Apparatus A 
or another appropriate apparatus may be used to determine the SAC using a validated 
assay. The number of actuations per determination should be one. 

1 Based on the labeled number of actuations, the terms, B lifestage, M lifestage, and E lifestage represent the first 
actuation(s) following the labeled number of priming actuations, the actuation(s) corresponding to 50 percent of 
the labeled number of actuations, and the actuation(s) corresponding to the labeled number of actuations, 
respectively. 

2 http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM319977.pdf 

 

Equivalence based on: Population bioequivalence (PBE) analysis of SAC. Please refer 
to the product-specific recommendation for Budesonide Inhalation Suspension for 
additional information regarding PBE.2 

 

2. Type of study: Aerodynamic particle size distribution (APSD) 


Design: The APSD test should be performed at the B and E lifestages of the product 
using a flow rate of 28.3 L/min or 30 L/min. The USP <601> Apparatus 1, Apparatus 6, 
or another appropriate method may be used to determine APSD using a validated assay. 


The APSD determination of each unit should be performed with a minimum number of 
inhalations justified by the sensitivity of the validated assay. 

Additional comments: Drug deposition on individual sites, including the mouthpiece 
adapter, the induction port, each stage of the cascade impactor (CI) and the filter, is 
requested. Mass balance accountability should be reported based on the sum of all 
deposition sites. For electronic submission of the individual CI data for the T and R 
products, please provide a table using the format in the Appendix, and send them as part 
of the abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) submission for BE evaluation. 

 

Equivalence based on: PBE analysis of impactor-sized mass (ISM).3 The CI profiles 
representing drug deposition on the individual stages of the CI along with the mass 
median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD), geometric standard deviation (GSD) and fine 
particle mass (FPM) should be submitted as supportive evidence for equivalent APSD. 

3 ISM is defined as a sum of the drug mass on all stages of the CI plus the terminal filter, but excluding the top CI 
stage because of its lack of a specified upper cutoff size limit. 

4 The distance between the actuator orifice and point of spray pattern measurement should be same for T and R. 

 

3. Type of study: Spray pattern 


Design: The spray pattern test should be performed at the B lifestage of the product and 
at two different distances from the actuator orifice. The selected distances should be at 
least 3 cm apart and based on the range of 3 to 7 cm from the R actuator mouthpiece.4 
Impaction (thin-layer chromatography plate impaction), non-impaction (laser light sheet 
technology), or other suitable method may be used to determine the spray pattern. 

Additional comments: Spray pattern should be measured quantitatively in terms of 
ovality ratio and area within the perimeter of the true shape (to include a high proportion, 
e.g., 95 % of the total pattern) for the automated analysis or ovality ratio and Dmax for the 
manual analysis. Ovality ratio is defined as the ratio of Dmax to Dmin. Dmax and Dmin are 
the longest and shortest diameters, respectively, that pass through the center of mass or 
the center of gravity, as appropriate. The number of sprays per spray pattern would 
preferably be one. 

 

Equivalence based on: At two selected distances, (i) qualitative comparison of spray 
shape, and (ii) PBE analysis of ovality ratio and area within the perimeter of the true 
shape or ovality ratio and Dmax. 

 

4. Type of study: Plume geometry 


Design: The plume geometry test should be performed at B lifestage of the product. The 
time sequence sound-triggered flash photography method, laser light sheet technology, or 
other suitable method may be used to determine the plume geometry at the appropriate 
post-actuation delay time. 

Additional comments: Plume geometry measurements should be reported at a single 
delay time while the fully developed plume is still in contact with the actuator 
mouthpiece. Plume geometry should be measured quantitatively in terms of plume angle 
and width. The plume angle is based on the conical region of the plume extending from a 
vertex that occurs at or near the actuator mouthpiece. The plume width is measured at a 


distance equal to the greater of the two distances selected for characterization of the spray 
pattern. 

 

Equivalence based on: Ratio of the geometric mean of the three batches of T to that of 
the three batches of R (based on log transformed data) for both plume angle and width, 
which should fall within 90-111%. 

 

5. Type of study: Priming and repriming 


Design: Priming and repriming tests should be based on the emitted dose (ex-actuator) of 
a single actuation immediately following the specified number of priming or repriming 
actuations specified in the R product labeling. The repriming test should be performed 
following storage for the specified period of non-use after initial use and/or other 
conditions (e.g., dropping), if the R product labeling provides such repriming 
information. 

Additional comments: For BE evaluation, the priming and repriming tests should be 
based on products stored in the valve upright position, with the exception of MDIs for 
which the R labeling recommends storage in the valve down position. The priming data 
can be based on the SAC data at the B lifestage. 

 

Equivalence based on: PBE analysis of the emitted dose of a single actuation 
immediately following the specified number of priming or repriming actuations specified 
in the R product labeling. 

______________________________________________________________________________ 

 

Pharmacokinetic (PK) BE Study 

 

FDA recommends that applicants conduct the following PK BE study for the T and R products. 

 

6. Type of Study: Fasting 


Design: Single-dose, two-way crossover 

Dose: 0.18 mg (two inhalations) 

Subjects: Normal healthy males and non-pregnant females, general population. 

Additional comments: The subjects enrolled for in vivo studies should be trained in the 
use of the inhalation aerosols in a standard fashion prior to each treatment session to 
assure a relatively consistent inspiratory flow rate and inspiratory duration. 

 

Analyte(s) to measure (in appropriate biological fluid): Albuterol in plasma 

 

Equivalence based on: AUC0-t, AUC0-8 and Cmax for albuterol. The 90% confidence 
intervals for the geometric mean T/R ratios of AUC and Cmax should fall within the limits 
of 80.00-125.00%. 

 

______________________________________________________________________________ 

 

Pharmacodynamic (PD) BE Study 

 


FDA recommends that applicants conduct a method using either bronchoprovocation (7a) or 
bronchodilatation (7b) study for the T and R products for this part of in vivo requirements. 

 

7a. Type of Study: Bronchoprovocation study 

Design: Single-dose, double-blind, double dummy, randomized, crossover study that is 
recommended at minimum to consist of: 

• Zero dose: One actuation each from two different placebo R inhalation aerosols 
and one actuation each from two different placebo T inhalation aerosols 
• 0.09 mg of R: One actuation each from the R inhalation aerosol and the placebo R 
inhalation aerosol and one actuation each from two different placebo T inhalation 
aerosols 
• 0.18 mg of R: One actuation each from two different R inhalation aerosol and one 
actuation each from two different placebo T inhalation aerosols 
• 0.09 mg of T: One actuation each from the T inhalation aerosol and the placebo T 
inhalation aerosol and one actuation each from two different placebo R inhalation 
aerosols 


No less than a 24 hour washout period should be allotted between treatments. 

Subjects: Males and non-pregnant females with asthma 

Additional comments: 

• Inclusion criteria should, at minimum, include: 
a. Male and non-pregnant female subjects (18-65 years of age). 
b. Stable mild asthmatics based on National Asthma Education and 
Prevention Program (NAEPP) guidelines. 
c. FEV1 = 80% of predicted. 
d. Airway responsiveness to methacholine demonstrated by a pre-albuterol-
dose (baseline) PC20 = 8 mg/mL. 
e. Nonsmokers for at least six months prior to the study and a maximum 
smoking history of five pack-years (the equivalent of one pack per day for 
five years). 
f. Written informed consent. 
• Exclusion criteria should, at minimum, include: 
a. Evidence of upper or lower respiratory tract infection (e.g., pneumonia, 
bronchitis, sinusitis) within six weeks prior to the study. 
b. History of seasonal asthma exacerbations, in which case the subject should 
be studied outside of the relevant allergen season. 
c. History of cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis or other respiratory diseases. 
d. History of cardiovascular, renal, neurologic, liver or endocrine 
dysfunction, including ECG with evidence of ischemic heart disease. 
e. Treatment in an emergency room or hospitalization for acute asthmatic 
symptoms or need for daily oral corticosteroids within past three months. 
f. Known intolerance or hypersensitivity to any component of the albuterol 
MDI. 
• The study day evaluation should take into consideration the following: 
a. Drug administration should begin within two weeks following screening 
for admission to the study. 



b. Baseline FEV1 should not be less than 70% of predicted normal value and 
within 88-112% of qualifying day FEV1 value. If either occurs, the study 
should be rescheduled. 
c. FEV1 due to the saline control should fall no more than 10% from the 
baseline FEV1, or the study should be postponed. This limits the drop in 
FEV1 shown by some subjects due to the saline control vehicle in which 
the challenge agent is dissolved. 
d. A subject failing three consecutive visits should be dropped from the 
study. 
• A Bio-IND is required prior to conduct of the PD study as the concentration of 
methacholine chloride solution may exceed the labeled 25.0 mg/mL 
concentration, particularly at the higher albuterol dose (e.g., 0.18 mg) where 25.0 
mg/mL methacholine chloride may not lead to a 20% reduction in FEV1. 
• Firms are encouraged to consider the conduct of a pilot study to refine the study 
design (e.g., inclusion and exclusion criteria) and estimate the study power based 
on intra- and inter-subject variability and slope of the Emax dose-response curve. 
The method for blinding should be described. 


 

PD endpoint(s): Post-dose PC20 or PD20, which are the provocative concentration or 
dose, respectively, of the methacholine challenge agent required to reduce the forced 
expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) by 20% following administration of differing 
doses of albuterol (or placebo) by inhalation. The 20% reduction in FEV1 is determined 
relative to the saline FEV1 measured before the placebo or albuterol administration. 

 

Equivalence based on: Dose-scale analysis of the PD data. For details regarding the 
dose-scale analysis, please refer to the product-specific recommendation for Orlistat Oral 
Capsule.5 The 90% confidence intervals for the relative bioavailability (F) should fall 
within 67.00-150.00% to establish equivalence in the PD study.

and one actuation each from two different placebo T inhalation aerosols 
• 0.09 mg of R: One actuation each from the R inhalation aerosol and the placebo R 
inhalation aerosol and one actuation each from two different placebo T inhalation 
aerosols 
• 0.18 mg of R: One actuation each from two different R inhalation aerosol and one 
actuation each from two different placebo T inhalation aerosols 
• 0.09 mg of T: One actuation each from the T inhalation aerosol and the placebo T 
inhalation aerosol and one actuation each from two different placebo R inhalation 
aerosols 


No less than a 24 hour washout period should be allotted between treatments.

b. Moderate-to-severe asthmatics based on NAEPP guidelines. 
c. FEV1 within 40-70% of predicted. 
d. Reversible airway obstruction as demonstrated by an improvement of 15% 
or more in FEV1 30 minutes after inhalation of two puffs (0.18 mg) of R 
inhalation aerosol. 
e. Nonsmokers for at least six months prior to the study and a maximum 
smoking history of five pack-years (the equivalent of one pack per day for 
five years). 
f. Written informed consent. 
• Exclusion criteria should, at minimum, include: 
a. History of cardiovascular, renal, neurologic, liver or endocrine 
dysfunction. 
b. Evidence of upper or lower respiratory tract infection (e.g., pneumonia,

MDI. 
• The study day evaluation should take into consideration the following: 
a. Randomized treatment should begin within two weeks of the screening 
visit. 
b. Baseline FEV1 should not be less than 45% of predicted or vary by more 
than ± 12% from screening visit FEV1 value. If either occurs, the study 
should be rescheduled. If the subject fails to meet these criteria on three 
separate study days (consecutive or not), they should be dropped from the 
study. 



• Firms are encouraged to consider the conduct of a pilot study to refine the study 
design (e.g., inclusion and exclusion criteria) and estimate the study power based 
on intra- and inter-subject variability and slope of the Emax dose-response curve. 
The method for blinding should be described. 
• FEV1 should be measured at 0, 10, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 300 and 360 
minutes (6 hours) post-dose. FEV1 should be defined as the highest of the three 
values obtained at each pulmonary function evaluation period. 
• For each treatment group, time to peak bronchodilator response (Tmax) and FEV1 
values at all measurement times within each evaluation period should be included 
in the final study report. 


 


PD endpoint(s): Areas under the effect curve calculated from the zero time to four hours 
(AUEC0-4h) and from zero time to six hours (AUEC0-6h) and maximum FEV1 (FEV1max). 
These endpoints should be baseline-adjusted using the pre-dose FEV1. 

 

Equivalence based on: Dose-scale analysis of the PD data. The 90% confidence 
intervals for Fs should fall within 67.00-150.00% to establish equivalence in the PD 
study. 

 

Additional comments: 

 

• The PD BE study may enroll all asthma patients who meet the inclusion and exclusion 
criteria, or may be enriched by using a sub-population of patients predicted to respond 
well to the study treatment (appropriate justification should be included for the 
population chosen for the study). 
• All spirometry should be conducted in accordance with the American Thoracic Society 
(ATS) standards. 
• The study protocol should include pre-specified definitions of asthma exacerbation, as 
well as pre-specified and appropriate escape criteria with consideration to patient safety. 
• It is the sponsor’s responsibility to enroll a sufficient number of subjects for the study to 
demonstrate BE of the T product to the R product. 
• The start and stop date of concomitant medication use during the study should be 
provided in the data set in addition to the reason for the medication use. The sponsor 
should clearly explain whether the medication was used prior to baseline visit, during the 
study or both. 
• All adverse events (AEs) should be reported, whether or not they are considered to be 
related to the treatment. The report of each AE should include the date of onset, 
description of AE, severity, relation to study medication, action taken, outcome, and date 
of resolution. The information will assist FDA in determining whether the incidence and 
severity of adverse reactions is different between the T and R products. 
• Subjects who discontinued from the study early should be identified, and the protocol 
should clearly, prospectively state how missing data will be handled in the statistical 
analysis and provide justification for the method chosen. The protocol should also 
include subject retention strategies and other plans to minimize missing data. 
• If there are missing data, adequate justification should be provided that the missing data 
do not lead to biased F estimation. 
• Detailed information for all subjects who are discontinued from the study should be 
provided. 
• Log transformation of the PD data before fitting the Emax model is recommended for 
dose-scale analysis.

Additional Information 

 

Formulation 

 


The T formulation is recommended to be qualitatively (Q1) 6 and quantitatively (Q2)7 the 
same as the R formulation. 

6 Q1 (qualitative sameness) means that the T product uses the same inactive ingredient(s) as the R product. 

7 Q2 (quantitative sameness) means that concentration of the inactive ingredient(s) used in the T product are within 
± 5% of those used in the R product. 

Device 

 

The T product should be similar in shape and size to the R product. The T product should 
have a dose counter if the R product has a dose counter. In vitro and in-use studies should be 
conducted to support the functionality, accuracy and robustness of the proposed T product. 

 

Applicants are encouraged to submit a working model of the proposed T MDI device to the 
Office of Generic Drugs prior to the ANDA submission, in order to ensure the eligibility of 
the proposed T MDI device under the 505(j) pathway.
