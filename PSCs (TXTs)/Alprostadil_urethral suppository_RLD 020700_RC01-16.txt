Additional comments regarding the clinical BE study with pharmacodynamic endpoint: 

 

1. The Office of Generic Drugs (OGD) recommends conducting a BE study with 
pharmacodynamic endpoint in the treatment of erectile dysfunction comparing the test 
product versus the reference listed drug (RLD) and vehicle control. Qualified subjects 
will be administered a maximum of nine doses of study treatment in the clinic. While 
dosing may begin with single doses of 0.125 mg, 0.25 mg or placebo, titration is required 
for the 0.5 mg and 1 mg doses. If the one dose of study treatment administered during the 
clinic visit did not result in an erection adequate for intercourse, recommend scheduling 
the next clinic visit in 1 to 5 days. This schedule will comply with the RLD labeling, 
which states that the maximum frequency of use is no more than two systems per 24-hour 



period, i.e., the RLD labeling permits the administration of a single dose of alprostadil 
urethral suppository during an afternoon clinic appointment followed the next day by the 
administration of a single dose of alprostadil urethral suppository during a morning 
appointment. 


 

2. The placebo control arm (vehicle of test product) is recommended to demonstrate that the 
test product and RLD are active and as a parameter to establish that the study is 
sufficiently sensitive to detect differences between products. 


 

3. Treatment is administered for at most nine clinic visits, with the initial three visits at 
either the 0.125 mg or 0.25 mg strength. Titration for the next higher dosage strength 
occurs only if the previous dose fails to result in an adequate erection. Because the RLD 
labeling recommends that patients are to be titrated to the lowest dose that is adequate for 
sexual intercourse, the minimum number of clinic visits is three and the maximum is 
nine. Once an erection adequate for intercourse occurs, titration should stop. Test, 
reference, and placebo should be administered for the strength at which an adequate 
erection occurs. The following is an example of such a treatment allocation schedule:

5. Exclusion criteria (the sponsor may add additional criteria): 
a. Female. 
b. Prior exposure to alprostadil (e.g., alprostadil urethral suppository, alprostadil cream, 
or alprostadil injection). 
c. Known allergy or hypersensitivity reaction to alprostadil or any of the study treatment 
excipients 
d. Sickle-cell or other disease interfering with study drug administration or trial 
participation. 
e. Myocardial infarction within previous six months and history of heath failure or 
unstable angina. 
f. Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. 
g. Active vasculitis. 
h. Untreated primary or secondary hypogonadism. 
i. Life expectancy less than six months 
j. Waking erections adequate for vaginal penetration within previous three months. 
k. Indwelling catheter. 
l. Abnormal penile anatomy, penile implant, or poor hygiene. 
m. Clinically significant anterior urethral stricture, meatal stenosis, or active urinary tract 
infection. 
n. History of Peyronie’s disease 





 

6. The protocol should include a list of the prescription and nonprescription/over-the-
counter drug products that are prohibited during the study, such as: 
a. Alprostadil-containing product, except for study medication. 
b. Device(s) for the treatment of erectile dysfunction 
c. Drug product(s) for the treatment of erectile dysfunction 





 

7. The recommended primary endpoint is erectile response during in-office titration where 0 
= “failure,” defined as an erection inadequate for intercourse, or 1 = “success,” defined as 
the subject achieving an erection adequate for intercourse during in-office titration. 


 

8. The protocol should clearly define the per-protocol (PP), modified intent-to-treat (mITT), 
and safety populations. 
a. The accepted PP population used for BE evaluation includes all randomized subjects 
who meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria, received at least one assigned study 
treatment, and did not have any protocol violations that would affect the treatment 
evaluation. 
b. The mITT population includes all randomized subjects who meet all 
inclusion/exclusion criteria and received at least one assigned study treatment. 



c. The safety population includes all randomized subjects who received at least one 
study treatment. 


 

9. Subjects who discontinued early from the study for any reason after receiving at least one 
assigned study treatment should be included in the PP and mITT populations. 


 

10. The start and stop dates of concomitant medication use during the study should be 
provided in the data set in addition to the reason for the medication use. The sponsor 
should clearly explain whether the medication was used prior to baseline visit, during the 
study, or both. 


 

11. All adverse events (AEs) should be reported, whether or not they are considered to be 
related to the treatment. The report of AEs should include date of onset, description of the 
AE, severity, relation to study medication, action taken, outcome, and date of resolution. 
This information is needed to determine if the incidence and severity of adverse reactions 
is different between the test product and RLD. 


 

12. If the inactive ingredients of the test product are different than those contained in the 
RLD or in significantly different amounts, then the sponsor must clearly describe the 
differences and provide information to show that the differences will not affect the safety, 
efficacy, and/or systemic or local availability of the drug. 


 

13. The method of randomization should be described in the protocol and the randomization 
schedule provided as a SAS data set in .xpt format (created using SAS XPORT). It is 
recommended that an independent third party generate and hold the randomization code 
throughout the conduct of the study in order to minimize bias. The sponsor may generate 
the randomization code if not involved in the packaging and labeling of the study 
medication. A sealed copy of the randomization scheme should be retained at the study 
site and should be available to FDA investigators at the time of site inspection to allow 
for verification of the treatment identity of each subject. 


 

14. A detailed description of the blinding procedure is to be provided in the protocol. The 
packaging of the test, reference and vehicle-control products should be similar in 
appearance to make differences in treatment less obvious to the subjects and examiners, 
and to maintain adequate blinding of evaluators. Neither the subject nor the investigator 
should be able to identify the treatment. 


 

15. Refer to 21 CFR 320.38, 320.63 and the Guidance for Industry: Handling and Retention 
of BA and BE Testing Samples regarding retention of study drug samples. Refer to 21 
CFR 320.36 for requirements for maintenance of records of BE testing. In addition, the 
investigators should follow the procedures of ICH E6, Good Clinical Practice: 
Consolidated Guideline, for retention of study records and data in order to conduct their 
studies in compliance with good laboratory practices (GLPs) and good clinical practices 
(GCPs). Retention samples should be randomly selected from the drug supplies received 
prior to dispensing to subjects. Retention samples should not be returned to the sponsor 
at any time. 



 

16. It is the sponsor's responsibility to enroll sufficient subjects for the study to demonstrate 
BE between the products. 


 

17. To establish bioequivalence, it is recommended the following compound hypotheses be 
tested using the PP population: 


 

HO: pT – pR < .1 or pT – pR > .2 versus HA: .1 = pT – pR = .2 

 

where pT = the success rate of the primary endpoint for the treatment group, and 

 pR = the success rate of the primary endpoint for the reference group. 

 

The null hypothesis, HO, is rejected with a type I error (a) of 0.05 (two one-sided tests) 
if the 90% confidence interval for the difference of the success rates between test and 
reference products (pT – pR) is contained within the interval [. 1, . 2], where . 1 = -
0.20 and . 2 = 0.20. Rejection of the null hypothesis supports the conclusion of 
equivalence of the two products. 

 

18. To establish sensitivity for each dosage strength, the test and reference products should 
both be statistically superior to the placebo. Conduct a separate appropriate inferential 
test for each dosage strength with a type I error (a) of 0.05, using the mITT population 
and the primary endpoint. 


 

19. Study data should be submitted to the OGD in electronic format. All data should be 
submitted as a SAS .xpt file, created using SAS XPORT (not CPORT). 


a. Include a list of file names, a description of the content of each file, an 
explanation of the variables within each file, and a description of all variable 
codes (for example, for the treatment variable, A = RLD and B = TEST). 

b. Provide a separate data set for demographic, vital sign, adverse event, 
disposition (including reason for discontinuation of treatment), concomitant 
medication, medical history, compliance, and comment variables. 

 

20. Provide a summary data set containing a separate line listing for each subject (if data 
exist) using the following headings, if applicable:

21. The study data should be submitted in standardized format. Consider the implementation and 
use of data standards as early as possible in the product development lifecycle, so that data 
standards are accounted for in the design, conduct, and analysis stages of clinical studies. For 
more details, please refer to 
http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/FormsSubmissionRequirements/ElectronicSubmissions/ucm248635.htm. 


 

22. The protocol should include a full detailed statistical analysis plan and describe how missing 
data will be prevented and handled if it exists. 


 

23. These recommendations are specific to this product and may not be appropriate for BE 
studies of any other product, including any other dosage form or strength of alprostadil.
