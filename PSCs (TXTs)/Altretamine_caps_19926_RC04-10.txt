 

Active ingredient: Altretamine 

 

Form/Route: Capsule/Oral 

 

Recommended studies: 1 study 

 

 Type of study: Steady-State 

Design: Multiple-dose, two-way crossover in-vivo 

Strength: Dose should be calculated on the basis of body surface area. Altretamine 
capsules may be administered at a dose of 260 mg/m2/day for 5 days. The total daily dose 
should be given as 4 divided oral doses after meals and at bedtime. The meals should be 
standardized, but there is no need to administer Altretamine with a high-fat meal. 

Subjects: Patients with persistent or recurring ovarian cancer following first-line therapy 
with a cisplatin and/or alkylating agent-based combination already on altretamine or 
previously determined to be candidates for such therapy. 

Additional Comments: 

 

1) Submission of an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) is required prior to the 
conduct of a bioequivalence study for a cytotoxic drug product such as Altretamine (see 
21 CFR §320.31). 




 

2) Period I can begin on the first day of treatment cycle. Pharmacokinetic sampling should 
take place on Day 5 of Period I and II. Blood sampling should occur over a dosing 
interval on the Day 5 morning to assess the concentration-time curve at pre-dose (0 hour) 
and at appropriate post-dose sampling time. Following end of Period I pharmacokinetic 
sampling day, patients should be switched to receive the other treatment in Period 2. 
Patients should be dosed for another 5 days prior to pharmacokinetic sampling for Period 
II. Both periods of the bioequivalence studies should be completed within one treatment 
cycle of Altretamine Capsules. 




 

3) Blood samples should be collected on the last three days (day 3, 4 and 5) of dosing in 
each period to ensure that steady-state blood plasma/serum levels are achieved. 
Attainment of steady state can be verified by regression analysis. The pre-dose blood 
sampling must include at least three successive trough level samples (Cmin). 




 

4) Applicants may consider using a reference-scaled average bioequivalence approach for 
this highly variable drug substance/product. Please provide evidence of high variability in 
the bioequivalence parameters, AUC and/or Cmax (i.e., within-subject variability =30%) 
when using this approach. For general information on this approach, please refer to 





Haidar et al., Bioequivalence Approaches for Highly Variable Drugs and Drug Products, 
Pharm. Res. 25:237-241(2008). To avoid variability from different treatment cycles, all 
the periods of the bioequivalence studies should be conducted within the same treatment 
cycle. 




 

5) After the study is completed, patients should be continued on their current dose of 
Altretamine. 




 

6) Since patients will be receiving different dosing regimens, dose should be included in the 
statistical model. Correction for differing dosing regimens by dose-normalization is not 
recommended. 




 

7) If it becomes necessary to adjust a patient’s dosing regimen, then that patient must be 
dropped from the bioequivalence study.

Analytes to measure (in appropriate biological fluid): Altretamine and its metabolites 
pentamethylmelamine and tetramethylmelamine in plasma 

 

Bioequivalence based on (90% CI): Altretamine 

 

Please submit the metabolites data as supportive evidence of comparable therapeutic outcome. 
For the metabolites, pentamethylmelamine and tetramethylmelamine, the following data should 
be submitted: individual and mean concentrations, individual and mean pharmacokinetic 
parameters, and geometric means and ratios of means for AUC and Cmax.

Please note that a Dissolution Methods Database is available to the public at the OGD website 
at http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/dissolution/index.cfm. Please find the dissolution 
information for this product at this website. Please conduct comparative dissolution testing on 12 
dosage units each of all strengths of the test and reference products. Specifications will be 
determined upon review of the application.
