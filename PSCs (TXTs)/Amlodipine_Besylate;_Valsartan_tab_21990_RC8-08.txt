 

Active ingredient: Amlodipine Besylate; Valsartan 

 

Form/Route: Tablets/Oral 

 

Recommended studies: 3 studies 

 

1. Type of study: Fasting 

Design: Single-dose, two-way crossover in-vivo 

Strength: 10 mg (base); 320 mg 

Subjects: Normal healthy males and females, general population 

Additional Comments: Females should not be pregnant, and if applicable, should practice 
abstention or contraception during the study. 

As an option, due to the relatively long half-life of amlodipine, you may wish to conduct this 
study using a single dose, two-way parallel design. As an additional option for either the 
crossover or parallel design, you may wish to truncate the AUC at 72 hours.

Analytes to measure (in appropriate biological fluid): Amlodipine and valsartan in plasma. 

 

Bioequivalence based on (90% CI): Amlodipine and valsartan 

 

Waiver request of in-vivo testing: 5 mg (base);160 mg and 5 mg (base);320 mg based on (i) acceptable 
bioequivalence studies on the 10 mg (base);160 mg and 10 mg (base);320 mg strengths, (ii) acceptable 
dissolution testing across all strengths, and (iii) proportional similarity in the formulations across all 
strengths. 

 

Dissolution test method and sampling times: 

 

Please note that a Dissolution Methods Database is available to the public at the OGD website at 
http://www.fda.gov/cder/ogd/index.htm. Please find the dissolution information for this product at this 
website. Please conduct comparative dissolution testing on 12 dosage units each of all strengths of the test 
and reference products. Specifications will be determined upon review of the application.
