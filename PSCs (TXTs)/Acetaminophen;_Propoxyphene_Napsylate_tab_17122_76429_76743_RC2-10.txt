2. Type of study: Fed 

Design: Single-dose, two-way crossover in-vivo 

Strength: 650 mg/100 mg 

Subjects: Healthy males and nonpregnant females, general population. 

Additional Comments: 




 

 

Analytes to measure (in appropriate biological fluid): Acetaminophen and propoxyphene Napsylate in 
plasma. 

 

Bioequivalence based on (90% CI): Acetaminophen and propoxyphene napsylate 

 

Waiver request of in-vivo testing: 325 mg/50 mg, 325 mg/100 mg, and 500 mg/100 mg based on (i) 
acceptable bioequivalence studies on the 650 mg/100 mg strength, (ii) acceptable dissolution testing of all 
strengths, and (iii) proportional similarity in the formulations across all strengths. 

 

Additional Comments: Since Acetaminophen and Propoxyphene Napsylate Tablets, 325 mg/50 mg and 650 
mg/100 mg; 325 mg/100 mg; and 500 mg/100 mg are the subject of three separate applications, three 
separate Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) must be submitted. A waiver of in vivo 
bioequivalence testing of the 325 mg/100 mg and the 500 mg/100 mg strengths may be requested if the 
criteria are met. The in vivo bioequivalence studies conducted on 650 mg/100 mg should be cross-
referenced, along with the in-vivo waiver request. Refer to the Guidance for Industry, Variations in Drug 
Products that May Be Included in a Single ANDA located at: 
http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/ 

Guidances/ucm072892.pdf. 

 

Dissolution test method and sampling times: 

 

Please note that a Dissolution Methods Database is available to the public at the OGD website at 
http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/dissolution/. Please find the dissolution information for this 
product at this website. Please conduct comparative dissolution testing on 12 dosage units each of all 
strengths of the test and reference products. Specifications will be determined upon review of the 
application.
