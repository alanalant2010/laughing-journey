Dissolution test method and sampling times: Please note that Dissolution Method Database is available 
to the public at the OGD website at http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/dissolution/. Please find 
the dissolution information for this product at this website. Please conduct comparative dissolution 
testing on 12 dosage units each of all strengths of the test and reference products. Specifications will be 
determined upon review of the application. 

 

In addition to the method above, for modified release products, dissolution profiles on 12 dosage units 
each of test and reference products generated using USP Apparatus I at 100 rpm and/or Apparatus II at 50 
rpm in at least three dissolution media (pH 1.2, 4.5, and 6.8 buffer) should be submitted in the 
application. Agitation speeds may have to be increased if appropriate. It is acceptable to add a small 
amount of surfactant, if necessary. Please include early sampling times of 1, 2, and 4 hours and continue 
every 2 hours until at least 80% of the drug is released. Specifications will be determined upon review of 
the data submitted in the application.
