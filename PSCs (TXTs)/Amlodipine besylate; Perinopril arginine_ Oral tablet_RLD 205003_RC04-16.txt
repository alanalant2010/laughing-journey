Analytes to measure (in appropriate biological fluid): Amlodipine, perindopril, and the active 
metabolite perindoprilat in plasma 

Bioequivalence based on (90% CI): amlodipine and perindopril 

Please submit the metabolite data (perindoprilat) as supportive evidence of comparable 
therapeutic outcome. For the metabolite, the following data should be submitted: individual and 
mean concentrations, individual and mean pharmacokinetic parameters, and geometric means 
and ratios of means for AUC and Cmax. 

Waiver request of in vivo testing: EQ 5 mg base/7 mg and EQ 2.5 mg base/3.5 mg based on (i) 
acceptable bioequivalence studies on the EQ 10 mg base/14 mg strength, (ii) acceptable in vitro 
dissolution testing of all strengths, and (iii) proportional similarity of the formulations across all 
strengths. 

Dissolution test method and sampling times: The dissolution information for this drug 
product can be found on the FDA-Recommended Dissolution Methods Web site, available to the 
public at the following location: http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/dissolution/. 
Conduct comparative dissolution testing on 12 dosage units each of all strengths of the test and 


reference products. Specifications will be determined upon review of the abbreviated new drug 
application (ANDA).
