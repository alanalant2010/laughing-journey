Analytes to measure (in appropriate biological fluid): Amitriptyline, and its active 
metabolite, nortriptyline, in plasma 

 

Bioequivalence based on (90% CI): Amitriptyline 

 

Please submit the metabolite data as supportive evidence of comparable therapeutic 
outcome. For the metabolite, please submit (i) individual and mean concentrations, (ii) 
individual and mean pharmacokinetic parameters, and (iii) geometric means and ratios of 
means for AUC and Cmax. 

 

Waiver request of in-vivo testing: 10 mg, 50 mg, 75 mg, 100 mg, and 150 mg based on 
(i) acceptable bioequivalence studies on the 25 mg strength, (ii) acceptable in-vitro 
dissolution testing of all strengths, and (iii) proportional similarity of the formulations 
across all strengths. 

 

Dissolution test method and sampling times: 

Please note that a Dissolution Methods Database is available to the public at the OGD 
website at http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/dissolution/. Please find the 
dissolution information for this product at this website. Please conduct comparative 
dissolution testing on 12 dosage units each of all strengths of the test and reference 
products. Specifications will be determined upon review of the application.
