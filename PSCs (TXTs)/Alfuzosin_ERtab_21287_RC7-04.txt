Dissolution test method and sampling times: 

 

Please note that a Dissolution Methods Database is available to the public at the OGD website at 
http://www.fda.gov/cder/ogd/index.htm. Please find the dissolution information for this product at this 
website. Please conduct comparative dissolution testing on 12 dosage units each of all strengths of the test 
and reference products. Specifications will be determined upon review of the application. 

 

In addition to the method above, for modified release products, dissolution profiles on 12 dosage units 
each of test and reference products generated using USP Apparatus I at 100 rpm and/or Apparatus II at 50 
rpm in at least three dissolution media (pH 1.2, 4.5 and 6.8 buffer) should be submitted in the application. 
Agitation speeds may have to be increased if appropriate. It is acceptable to add a small amount of 
surfactant, if necessary. Please include early sampling times of 1, 2, and 4 hours and continue every 2 
hours until at least 80% of the drug is released, to provide assurance against premature release of drug 
(dose dumping) from the formulation. Specifications will be determined upon review of the data 
submitted in the application.
