Waiver request of in-vivo testing: (1. 25 mg; 1.25 mg; 1.25mg; 1.25 mg), (2.5 mg, 2.5 
mg. 2.5 mg, 2.5 mg), (3.75 mg, 3.75 mg, 3.75 mg, 3.75 mg), (5 mg, 5 mg, 5 mg, 5 mg), 
and (6.25 mg, 6.25 mg, 6.25 mg, 6.25 mg) based on (i) acceptable bioequivalence studies 
on the (7.5 mg, 7.5 mg, 7.5 mg, 7.5 mg) strength, (ii) acceptable dissolution testing across 
all strengths, and (iii) proportional similarity in the formulations across all strengths. 

Please refer to the Mirtazapine Tablet Draft Guidance for additional information 
regarding waivers of in-vivo testing. 

 

Dissolution test method and sampling times: 

Please note that a Dissolution Methods Database is available to the public at the OGD 
website at http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/dissolution/index.cfm. Please find 
the dissolution information for this product at this website. Please conduct comparative 
dissolution testing on 12 dosage units each of all strengths of the test and reference 
products. Specifications will be determined upon review of the application. 

 

In addition to the method above, for modified-release products, dissolution profiles on 12 
dosage units each of test and reference products generated using USP Apparatus I at 100 
rpm and/or Apparatus II at 50 rpm in at least three dissolution media (pH 1.2, 4.5 and 6.8 
buffer) should be submitted in the application. Agitation speeds may have to be increased 
if appropriate. It is acceptable to add a small amount of surfactant, if necessary. Please 
include early sampling times of 1, 2, and 4 hours and continue every 2 hours until at least 
80% of the drug is released, to provide assurance against premature release of drug (dose 
dumping) from the formulation. 

 

Additional Comments: 

 

The Adderall XR® Capsule labeling states that “Adderall XR® capsule contains two types 
of drug-containing beads designed to give a double-pulsed delivery of amphetamines, 
which prolongs the release of amphetamine from Adderall XR® compared to the 
conventional Adderall (immediate-release) tablet formulation.” Further, the label states 
that “patients taking divided doses of immediate-release Adderall®, (for example, twice 
daily), may be switched to Adderall XR® at the same total daily dose taken once daily.” 

 

Thus, Adderall XR® is a multiphasic, modified-release formulation designed to mimic the 
drug release of two Adderall [immediate release (IR) mixed amphetamine] tablet 
formulations taken four hours apart. According to the FDA-approved labeling for this 
product, clinical studies showed statistically significant improvement in behavioral 
assessment scores, following once daily dosing of Adderall XR®. As this multiphasic, 
modified-release dosage form is designed to achieve quick onset of activity, mimicking 
that of IR mixed amphetamine tablet formulation followed by sustained activity for the 
remainder of the day, the FDA suggests that additional BE metrics may be appropriate to 
ensure that a generic (test) version is therapeutically equivalent to the corresponding 
reference product. Thus, for Adderall XR® the following two pAUC metrics are proposed 
in addition to the traditional metrics [AUC8 (area under the curve from 0 to infinity), and 
Cmax (maximum plasma concentration)]: 


• AUC0-5 should compare test & reference systemic exposure responsible for early 
onset of response during the early part of the once-daily dosing interval, where 
AUC0-5 is the area under the plasma-concentration vs. time curve from 0 to 5 
hours; and 

• AUC5-t should compare test & reference systemic exposure responsible for 
sustaining the response later during the once-daily dosing interval, where AUC5-t 
is area under the curve from 5 hours to the last measurable time point. 

 

The 90% confidence intervals of the geometric mean test/reference (T/R) ratios for the 
above four metrics (Cmax, AUC0-5, AUC5-t, AUC8) should fall within the BE limits of 80-
125% for d-amphetamine and l-amphetamine. 

 

Fasting, Fed, and Fasting sprinkle-in-applesauce Studies: Log-transformed AUC0-5, 
AUC5-t, AUC8, and Cmax. The partial AUCs (pAUCs), AUC0-5 and AUC5-t, have been 
determined to be the most appropriate parameters for evaluation of the drug 
bioavailability responsible for the rapid onset and sustained maintenance of the clinical 
response throughout the 24 hr dosing period1. These two pAUCs replace the usual AUC0-
t, and together with the other bioequivalence (BE) parameters, AUC0-8 and Cmax, will 
ensure that the pharmacokinetic profiles and clinical effects of test and reference products 
are sufficiently similar. 

 

The sampling time of 5 hours for the first pAUC is based on time at which 90-95% of 
subjects are likely to achieve optimal early onset of response, for the following reasons: 

• The Tmax of IR mixed amphetamine formulation is about 3 hours in fasting 
subjects. Available evidence indicates that food does not affect the Tmax of this IR 
formulation; 


• The standard deviation of Tmax for IR mixed amphetamine formulation is 1 hour; 


• Since, approximately 95% of observations fall within two standard deviations of 
the mean, the first pAUC sampling time will be Tmax mean ± 2 x standard 
deviation of the IR formulation, i.e. 3 hr ± 2 hr. 




 

This should provide additional assurance that a test and reference product will be 
therapeutically equivalent over the early part of the daily dosing interval, corresponding 
to onset of response. Likewise, AUC5-t should ensure that two products are 
therapeutically equivalent over the later part of the daily dosing interval.
