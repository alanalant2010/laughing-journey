Dissolution test method and sampling times: 

 

Please note that a Dissolution Methods Database is available to the public at the OGD website at 
http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/dissolution/. Please find the dissolution information for this 
product at this website. Please conduct comparative dissolution testing on 12 dosage units each of all 
strengths of the test and reference products. 

 

For modified release products, dissolution profiles generated using USP Apparatus I at 100 rpm and/or 
Apparatus II at 50 rpm in at least three dissolution media (pH 1.2, 4.5 and 6.8 buffers, water) should be 
submitted in the application. Agitation speeds may have to be increased if appropriate. It is acceptable to 
add a small amount of surfactant, if necessary. The following sampling times are recommended: 1, 2, and 
4 hours and every 2 hours thereafter, until at least 80% of the drug is dissolved. Comparative dissolution 
profiles should include individual tablet data as well as the mean, range, and standard deviation at each 
time point for twelve tablets. Specifications will be determined upon review of the data submitted in the 
application.
