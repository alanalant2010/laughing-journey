Analytes to measure (in appropriate biological fluid): Amoxicillin and clavulanate 
potassium in plasma 

 

Bioequivalence based on (90% CI): Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium 

 

Waiver request of in-vivo testing: 125 mg/5 mL; Eq. 31.25 mg base/5 mL, based on 

(i) acceptable bioequivalence studies on the 250 mg/5 mL; Eq. 62.5 mg base/5 mL 
strength, (ii) acceptable in-vitro dissolution testing of all strengths, and (iii) proportional 
similarity of the formulations across all strengths. Please refer to the Mirtazapine Tablet 
Draft Guidance for additional information regarding dose proportionality. 

 

Dissolution test method and sampling times: Please note that a Dissolution Methods 
Database is available to the public at the OGD website 
http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/dissolution/. Please find the dissolution 
information for this product at this website. Please conduct comparative dissolution 
testing on 12 dosage units each of all strengths of the test and reference products. 
Specifications will be determined upon review of the application.
