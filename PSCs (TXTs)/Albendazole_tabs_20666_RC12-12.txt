Analytes to measure (in appropriate biological fluid): Albendazole and its active metabolite, 
albendazole sulfoxide, in plasma 

 

Please submit the metabolite data as supportive evidence of comparable therapeutic outcome. For the 
metabolite, following data should be submitted: individual and mean concentrations, individual and 
mean pharmacokinetic parameters, and geometric means and ratios of means for AUC and Cmax. 

Bioequivalence based on (90% CI): Albendazole 

 

However, if you can demonstrate that it is not possible to measure albendazole in plasma accurately and 
reliably, please analyze the albendazole sulfoxide using the confidence interval approach. 

 

Waiver request of in-vivo testing: Not applicable 

 

Dissolution test method and sampling times: 

 

Please note that a Dissolution Methods Database is available to the public at the OGD website at 
http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/dissolution/. Please find the dissolution information for this 
product at this website. Please conduct comparative dissolution testing on 12 dosage units each of all 
strengths of the test and reference products. Specifications will be determined upon review of the 
application.
