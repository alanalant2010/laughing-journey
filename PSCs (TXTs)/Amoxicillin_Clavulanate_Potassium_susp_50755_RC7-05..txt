Analytes to measure: Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium in plasma 

 

Bioequivalence based on (90% CI): Amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium 

 

Waiver request of in-vivo testing: 200 mg/EQ 28.5 mg (base)/5 mL based on (i) acceptable 
bioequivalence studies on the 400 mg/EQ 57 mg (base)/5 mL strength, (ii) proportional similarity of the 
200 mg/EQ 28.5 mg (base)/5 mL and 400 mg/EQ 57 mg (base)/5 mL strengths, and (iii) acceptable in 
vitro dissolution testing of the 200 mg/EQ 28.5 mg (base)/5 mL and 400 mg/EQ 57 mg (base)/5 mL 
strengths.

Please note that a Dissolution Methods Database is available to the public at the OGD website at 
http://www.fda.gov/cder/ogd/index.htm. Please find the dissolution information for this product at this 
website. Please conduct comparative dissolution testing on 12 dosage units each of all strengths of the test 
and reference products. Specifications will be determined upon review of the application.
