Additional comments: Amphetamine, a CNS stimulant, has a high potential for abuse and 
dependence, and can cause sudden death or other serious heart problems at recommended 
doses according to the drug product label, applicants should assess the risk of abuse and 
the presence of cardiac diseases prior to the study. Avoid use in patients with known 
structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart arrhythmia, coronary 
artery disease, and other serious heart problems. Monitor for signs of abuse and heart 
problems during the study.

Analytes to measure (in appropriate biological fluid): d-amphetamine and l-amphetamine, 
separately, in plasma 

 

Bioequivalence based on (90% CI): d-amphetamine and l-amphetamine 

 

Waiver request of in vivo testing: Not applicable. 

 

Dissolution test method and sampling times: The dissolution information for this drug 
product can be found on the FDA-Recommended Dissolution Methods website available to the 
public at the following location: http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/dissolution/. 
Conduct comparative dissolution testing on 12 dosage units each of all strengths of the test and 


reference products. Note that a dosage unit for a suspension is the labeled strength (mL). 
Specifications will be determined upon review of the abbreviated new drug application (ANDA). 

In addition to the method above, for modified release products, dissolution profiles on 12 dosage 
units each of test and reference products generated using USP Apparatus I at 100 rpm and/or 
Apparatus II at 50 rpm in at least three dissolution media (pH 1.2, 4.5 and 6.8 buffer) should be 
submitted in the application. Agitation speeds may have to be increased if appropriate. It is 
acceptable to add a small amount of surfactant, if necessary. Please include early sampling times 
of 1, 2, and 4 hours and continue every 2 hours until at least 80% of the drug is released, to 
provide assurance against premature release of drug (dose dumping) from the formulation. 
Specifications will be determined upon review of the data submitted in the application. 

 

Due to a concern of dose dumping of drug from this drug product when taken with alcohol, the 
Agency currently requests that additional dissolution testing be conducted using various 
concentrations of ethanol in the dissolution medium, as follows: 

 

Testing Conditions: Volume: 900 mL 0.1N HCl, apparatus 2 (Paddle) at 50 rpm, with and 
without the alcohol; 

 

Test 1: Twelve units tested according to the proposed method, with data collected every 15 
minutes for a total of 2 hours 

Test 2: Twelve units analyzed by substituting 5% (v/v) of test medium with Alcohol USP and 
data collection every 15 minutes for a total of 2 hours 

Test 3: Twelve units analyzed by substituting 20% (v/v) of test medium with Alcohol USP and 
data collection every 15 minutes for a total of 2 hours 

Test 4: Twelve units analyzed by substituting 40% (v/v) of test medium with Alcohol USP and 
data collection every 15 minutes for a total of 2 hours 

 

Both test and RLD products must be tested accordingly and data must be provided on individual 
unit, means, range and %CV on all strengths. 

 

Additional Comments: 

DYANAVEL XR is an extended-release liquid formulation containing immediate and extended-
release components in a 3.2 to 1 ratio of d-amphetamine to l-amphetamine, allowing to be taken 
once daily for its quick-onset and sustained activities. As per the FDA-approved labeling, the 
median (range) time to peak plasma concentrations (Tmax) were 4.0 (2 – 7) hours after a single, 
18.8 mg oral dose of DYANAVEL XR under fasting conditions, and the clinical efficacy studies 
of DYANAVEL XR indicates that SKAMP-Combined change scores from pre-dose 
demonstrated a statistically significant improvement at the time points of 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13 
hours post-dosing with DYANAVEL XR, using the change from pre-dose in the SKAMP-


Combined score at 4 hours post-dosing as the primary efficacy endpoint, and the onset and 
duration of clinical effect as the key secondary efficacy parameters. To ensure that a generic 
version of is therapeutically equivalent to the corresponding reference product, the firm should 
conduct the following pAUC metrics in addition to the tratidional (AUC0-8 and Cmax) metrics: 

• AUC0-4 should compare test & reference systemic exposure responsible for early 
onset of response during the early part of the once-daily dosing interval; and 
• AUC4-t should compare test & reference systemic exposure responsible for sustaining 
the response later during the once-daily dosing interval. 




The 90% confidence intervals of the geometric mean test/reference (T/R) ratios for the above 
four metrics (Cmax, AUC0-4, AUC4-t, AUC0-8) should fall within the BE limits of 80-125%. 

The sampling time of 4 hours for the first pAUC is based on the pharmacokinetic profiles and 
clinical efficacy studies from FDA-approved drug product label.
