Dosage Form; Route: Tablet; oral 

 

Recommended Studies: Two studies 

 

1. Type of study: Fasting 


Design: Single-dose, two-way crossover in vivo 

Strength: 250 mg 

Subjects: Healthy males , general population. 

Additional Comments: 

• Study population should consist of healthy males at least 18 years old. 
• Study participants must be in good general health as determined by no clinically 
significant findings on medical history, physical examination, vital signs, 12-lead 
electrocardiogram consistent with normal cardiac conduction and function, and 
clinical laboratory measurements. 
• Monitor vital signs and serum electrolytes during the course of the study. 
• Perform a 12-lead ECG at baseline and at the end of the study. 
• Inform study participants that it is not known whether abiraterone or its metabolites 
are present in semen. Study participants should use adequate contraception during the 
study and for at least one week after the last abiraterone acetate dose.

2. Type of study: Fed 


Design: Single-dose, two-way crossover in vivo 

Strength: 250 mg 

Subjects: Healthy males, general population. 

Additional Comments: 

• The reference listed drug (RLD) labeling indicates that abiraterone acetate tablets 
must be taken on an empty stomach. However, due to the complex food effects 
associated with abiraterone acetate tablets, FDA recommends applicants conduct a 
BE study under fed conditions. 
• See the fasted study design above for additional comments.
