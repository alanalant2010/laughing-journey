

Active Ingredient: Amphetamine 



Dosage Form; Route: Extended release orally disintegrating tablets; oral 



Recommended Studies: Two studies 





1.Type of study: FastingDesign: Single-dose, two-way crossover in vivoStrength: EQ 18.8 MG BASESubjects: Healthy males and nonpregnant females, general population.
Additional Comments:
•Amphetamine, a CNS stimulant, has a high potential for abuse and dependence, andcan cause sudden death or other serious heart problems at recommended dosesaccording to the drug product label, applicants should assess the risk of abuse and thepresence of cardiac diseases prior to the study. Avoid use in patients with knownstructural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart arrhythmia, coronaryartery disease, and other serious heart problems. Monitor for signs of abuse and heartproblems during the study.
•The orally disintegrating tablet should be placed on the tongue and allowed todisintegrate without water.
•The 90% confidence intervals of the geometric mean test/reference (T/R) ratios for themetrics (Cmax, AUC0-5, AUC5-t, AUC0-8) should fall within the limits of 80-125%.

Analytes to measure (in appropriate biological fluid): d-amphetamine and l-amphetamine, 
separately, in plasma 

Bioequivalence based on (90% CI): d-amphetamine and l-amphetamine 
Please refer to Additional Comments above for more guidance regarding bioequivalence. 


Waiver request of in vivo testing: EQ 3.1 MG BASE, EQ 6.3 MG BASE, EQ 9.4 MG BASE, 
EQ 12.5 MG BASE, and EQ 15.7 MG BASE strengths based on (i) acceptable bioequivalence 
studies on the EQ 18.8MG BASE strength, (ii) acceptable in-vitro dissolution testing of all 
strengths, and (iii) proportional similarity of the formulations across all strengths. Please refer to 
the Mirtazapine Tablet Draft Guidance for additional information regarding waivers of in vivo 
testing. 

Dissolution test method and sampling times: The dissolution information for this drug product 
can be found on the FDA-Recommended Dissolution Methods web site, available to the public at 
the following location: http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/dissolution/. Conduct 
comparative dissolution testing on 12 dosage units each of all strengths of the test and reference 
products. Specifications will be determined upon review of the abbreviated new drug application 
(ANDA). 

In addition to the method above, for modified release products, dissolution profiles on 12 dosage 
units each of test and reference products generated using USP Apparatus I at 100 rpm and/or 
Apparatus II at 50 rpm in at least three dissolution media (pH 1.2, 4.5 and 6.8 buffer) should be 
submitted in the application. Agitation speeds may have to be increased if appropriate. It is 
acceptable to add a small amount of surfactant, if necessary. Please include early sampling times 
of 1, 2, and 4 hours and continue every 2 hours until at least 80% of the drug is released, to 
provide assurance against premature release of drug (dose dumping) from the formulation. 
Specifications will be determined upon review of the data submitted in the application. 

Due to a concern of dose dumping of drug from this drug product when taken with alcohol, the 
Agency currently requests that additional dissolution testing be conducted using various 
concentrations of ethanol in the dissolution medium, as follows: 

Testing Conditions: Volume: 900 mL 0.1N HCl, USP apparatus 2 (basket) at 100 rpm, with and 
without alcohol: 

Test 1: Twelve units tested according to the proposed method, with data collected every 
15 minutes for a total of 2 hours 

Test 2: Twelve units analyzed by substituting 5% (v/v) of test medium with Alcohol USP and 
data collection every 15 minutes for a total of 2 hours 

Test 3: Twelve units analyzed by substituting 20% (v/v) of test medium with Alcohol USP and 
data collection every 15 minutes for a total of 2 hours 

Test 4: Twelve units analyzed by substituting 40% (v/v) of test medium with Alcohol USP and 
data collection every 15 minutes for a total of 2 hours 

Both test and RLD products must be tested accordingly and data must be provided on individual 
unit, means, range and %CV on all strengths.
