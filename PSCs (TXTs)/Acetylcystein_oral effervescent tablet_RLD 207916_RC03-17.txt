

Active Ingredient: Acetylcysteine 



Dosage Form; Route: Effervescent tablets; oral 



Recommended Studies: Two options: in vitro or in vivo studies 



I. In Vitro Disintegration Testing 




To qualify for a waiver of the in vivo bioequivalence study requirement under 21 CFR 
§320.22(b)(3), applicants should demonstrate that generic versions of AcetylcysteineEffervescent Tablets are fully dissolved in 200 mL of purified water at the time of administration 
with six dosage units each of all strengths of the test and reference products by in vitro 
disintegration testing. Specifications will be determined upon review of the abbreviated new 
drug application (ANDA). The generic drug product should also contain the same active drug 
ingredient in the same concentration and dosage form as the Reference Listed Drug (RLD) and 
should not contain any excipients that may significantly affect drug absorption and systemic 
availability.

Analytes to measure (in appropriate biological fluid): Acetylcysteine in plasma 



Bioequivalence based on (90% CI): Acetylcysteine 




Waiver request of in-vivo testing: 500 mg based on (i) acceptable bioequivalence studies on 
the 2500 mg strength, (ii) acceptable in vitro disintegration testing of all strengths, and (iii) 
proportional similarity of the formulations across all strengths.
