Dosage Form; Route: Lotion (augmented); topical 

 

Recommended Studies: A waiver of the requirement for the submission of evidence 

obtained in vivo measuring bioavailability or demonstrating bioequivalence may be 
requested in situations where the proposed drug product meets all the requirements 
specified in 21 CFR 320.22(b)(3). Alternatively, in situations where the proposed drug 
product contains a change in formulation from the reference listed drug product that may 
significantly affect the systemic or local availability of the active ingredient, two 
vasoconstrictor studies are recommended.
