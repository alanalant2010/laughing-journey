Recommended study: Request for Waiver of In vivo Bioequivalence Study Requirements 

 

Bioequivalence study recommendations: 

 

To qualify for a waiver of the in vivo bioequivalence (BE) study requirements under 21 CFR 
320.22(b)(1), the generic ophthalmic solution product must have the same active and inactive 
ingredients in the same concentration as the reference listed drug product (RLD). 

 

An ophthalmic drug product may differ from the RLD in preservative, buffer, substance to adjust 
tonicity, or thickening agent [(as permitted by the chemistry, manufacturing and controls (CMC) 
regulations for abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs), 21 CFR 314.94(a)(9)(iv)], provided 
that the applicant identifies and characterizes the differences and provides information 
demonstrating that the differences do not affect the safety or efficacy of the proposed drug 
product. 

 

Changes in any of the inactive ingredients can change the safety and efficacy of an ophthalmic 
drug product. Therefore, an in vivo clinical endpoint bioequivalence study is needed for any 
ophthalmic solution that has a different inactive ingredient or a difference of more than 5% in the 
amount of any inactive ingredient compared to that of the RLD. Please submit a protocol to the 
Clinical Review Team in the Office of Generic Drugs for review and concurrence prior to 
conducting the in vivo clinical endpoint BE study for such a product.
