This draft guidance, once finalized, will represent the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) 
current thinking on this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does 
not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies

Analytes to measure: Budesonide in plasma 

 

Bioequivalence based on (90% CI): Budesonide 

 

Additional comments regarding the BE study with PK endpoints: 

(1). Applicants may consider using a reference-scaled average bioequivalence (BE) 
approach for budesonide. If using this approach, the applicant should provide evidence 
of high variability in the BE parameters (i.e., within-subject variability > 30%) for the 
reference product. For general information on this approach, refer to the progesterone 
capsule guidance for additional information regarding highly variable drugs. 

 

(2). For the fasting study, the following PK parameters will be evaluated: Log-
transformed AUC0-4, AUC4-t, AUC0-8, and Cmax, where AUC0-4 is the area under the 
plasma concentration vs. time curve from 0 to 4 hours, AUC4-t is the area under the 
plasma concentration vs. time curve from 4 to the last measurable time point. Applicants 
should have extensive sampling points around Tmax to have accurate estimation of Cmax 
and Tmax, and at least four non-zero measurements of concentration are recommended for 


each partial AUC. For the fed study, the following PK parameters will be evaluated: 
Log-transformed AUC0-t, AUC0-8, and Cmax. Applicants should submit AUC0-4 and 
AUC4-t data as supportive evidence of comparable therapeutic outcome. 

 

 

 

3. Type of study: In vitro comparative dissolution study 

Strength: 3 mg 

Apparatus: U.S. Pharmacopoeia (USP) Apparatus 2 (paddle), with capsule 
sinker 

Pretreatment stage: 2 hours in 1000 mL 0.1 N HCl at 75 rpm

 (1) pH 4.5 acetate buffer at 75 rpm 

 (2) pH 6.0 phosphate buffer at 75 rpm 

 (3) pH 6.5 phosphate buffer at 75 rpm 

 (4) pH 6.8 phosphate buffer at 75 rpm 

 (5) pH 7.2 phosphate buffer at 75 rpm 

 (6) pH 7.5 phosphate buffer at 75 rpm 

 Volume: 1000 mL 

 Temperature: 37º C 

Sample times: 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, and 8 hours, or as needed for profile 
comparison 

Additional comments: The applicant should use at least 12 dosage units of both the test 
and reference products per test

Waiver request of in vivo testing: Not applicable 

 

Dissolution test method and sampling times: The dissolution information for this drug 
product can be found on the FDA-Recommended Dissolution Methods website available to the 
public at the following location: http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/dissolution/. 
Conduct comparative dissolution testing on 12 dosage units each of all strengths of the test and 
reference products. Specifications will be determined upon review of the abbreviated new drug 
application (ANDA).
