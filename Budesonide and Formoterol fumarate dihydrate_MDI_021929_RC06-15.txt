This draft guidance, when finalized, will represent the current thinking of the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA, or the Agency) on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person 
and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if it satisfies the 
requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. To discuss an alternative approach, contact 
the Office of Generic Drugs. 

 

Active Ingredient: Budesonide; Formoterol fumarate dihydrate 

 

Dosage Form; Route: Aerosol; metered; inhalation 

 

Strength: 0.08 mg/INH; 0.0045 mg/INH 

0.160 mg/INH; 0.0045 mg/INH 

 

Recommended Studies: In vitro and in vivo studies 

 

FDA recommends the following in vitro and in vivo studies to establish bioequivalence (BE) of 
the test (T) and reference (R) metered dose inhalers (MDIs) containing budesonide and 
formoterol fumarate dihydrate. 

______________________________________________________________________________ 

 

In Vitro Studies 

 

FDA recommends that applicants conduct the following in vitro studies for both strengths of the 
T and R products. For each strength, use at least three batches each of T and R products, with no 
fewer than 10 units from each batch. 

 

1. Type of study: Single actuation content (SAC) 


Design: The SAC test should be performed at the beginning (B), middle (M), and end 
(E) lifestages1 of the product using a flow rate of 28.3 L/min. U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP) 
<601> Apparatus A or another appropriate apparatus may be used to determine the SAC 
using a validated assay. The number of actuations per determination should be one. 

1 Based on the labeled number of actuations, the terms, B lifestage, M lifestage, and E lifestage represent the first actuation(s) 
following the labeled number of priming actuations, the actuation(s) corresponding to 50 percent of the labeled number of 
actuations, and the actuation(s) corresponding to the labeled number of actuations, respectively. 

2 http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/UCM319977.pdf 

 

Equivalence based on: Population bioequivalence (PBE) analysis of SAC. The 
budesonide inhalation suspension BE guidance provides additional information regarding 
PBE.2 

 

2. Type of study: Aerodynamic particle size distribution (APSD) 


Design: The APSD test should be performed at the B and E lifestages of the product 
using a flow rate of 28.3 L/min or 30 L/min. The USP <601> Apparatus 1, Apparatus 6, 
or another appropriate method may be used to determine APSD using a validated assay. 


The APSD determination of each unit should be performed with a minimum number of 
inhalations justified by the sensitivity of the validated assay. 

Additional comments: Drug deposition on individual sites, including the mouthpiece 
adapter, the induction port, each stage of the cascade impactor (CI), and the filter, is 
requested. Mass balance accountability should be reported based on the sum of all 
deposition sites. For electronic submission of the individual CI data for the T and R 
products, provide a table using the format in the appendix, and send them as part of the 
abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) submission for BE evaluation. 

 

Equivalence based on: PBE analysis of impactor-sized mass (ISM).3 The CI profiles 
representing drug deposition on the individual stages of the CI along with the mass 
median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD), geometric standard deviation (GSD), and fine 
particle mass (FPM) should be submitted as supportive evidence for equivalent APSD. 

3 ISM is defined as a sum of the drug mass on all stages of the CI plus the terminal filter, but excluding the top CI stage because 
of its lack of a specified upper cutoff size limit. 

4 The distance between the actuator orifice and point of spray pattern measurement should be same for T and R. 

 

3. Type of study: Spray pattern 


Design: The spray pattern test should be performed at the B lifestage of the product and 
at two different distances from the actuator orifice. The selected distances should be at 
least 3 cm apart and based on the range of 3 to 7 cm from the R actuator mouthpiece.4 
Impaction (thin-layer chromatography plate impaction), non-impaction (laser light sheet 
technology), or other suitable method may be used to determine the spray pattern. 

Additional comments: Spray pattern should be measured quantitatively in terms of 
ovality ratio and area within the perimeter of the true shape (to include a high proportion, 
e.g., 95 %, of the total pattern) for the automated analysis or ovality ratio and Dmax for the 
manual analysis. Ovality ratio is defined as the ratio of Dmax to Dmin. Dmax and Dmin are 
the longest and shortest diameters, respectively, that pass through the center of mass or 
the center of gravity, as appropriate. The number of sprays per spray pattern would 
preferably be one. 

 

Equivalence based on: At two selected distances, (i) qualitative comparison of spray 
shape, and (ii) PBE analysis of ovality ratio and area within the perimeter of the true 
shape or ovality ratio and Dmax. 

 

4. Type of study: Plume geometry 


Design: The plume geometry test should be performed at B lifestage of the product. The 
time sequence sound-triggered flash photography method, laser light sheet technology, or 
other suitable method may be used to determine the plume geometry at the appropriate 
post-actuation delay time. 

Additional comments: Plume geometry measurements should be reported at a single 
delay time while the fully developed plume is still in contact with the actuator 
mouthpiece. Plume geometry should be measured quantitatively in terms of plume angle 
and width. The plume angle is based on the conical region of the plume extending from a 
vertex that occurs at or near the actuator mouthpiece. The plume width is measured at a 


distance equal to the greater of the two distances selected for characterization of the spray 
pattern. 

 

Equivalence based on: Ratio of the geometric mean of the three batches of T to that of 
the three batches of R (based on log-transformed data) for both plume angle and width, 
which should fall within 90 – 111%. 

 

5. Type of study: Priming and repriming 


Design: Priming and repriming tests should be based on the emitted dose (ex-actuator) of 
a single actuation immediately following the specified number of priming or repriming 
actuations specified in the R product labeling. The repriming test should be performed 
following storage for the specified period of non-use after initial use and/or other 
conditions (e.g., dropping), if the R product labeling provides such repriming 
information. 

Additional comments: For BE evaluation, the priming and repriming tests should be 
based on products stored in the valve-upright position, with the exception of MDIs for 
which the R labeling recommends storage in the valve-down position. The priming data 
can be based on the SAC data at the B lifestage. 

 

Equivalence based on: PBE analysis of the emitted dose of a single actuation 
immediately following the specified number of priming or repriming actuations specified 
in the R product labeling. 

 

Pharmacokinetic BE Study 

FDA recommends that applicants conduct the following pharmacokinetic (PK) BE study for both 
strengths of the T and R products. 

 

6. Type of study: Fasting 


Design: Single-dose, two-way crossover 

Dose: Minimum number of inhalations that is sufficient to characterize a PK profile by 
using a sensitive analytical method 

Subjects: Normal healthy males and nonpregnant females, general population 

Additional comments: The subjects enrolled for in vivo studies should be trained in the 
use of the inhalation aerosols in a standard fashion prior to each treatment session to 
ensure a relatively consistent inspiratory flow rate and inspiratory duration. A Bio-IND 
is required prior to conduct of the PK study if the dose exceeds the maximum labeled 
single dose. 

 

Analyte(s) to measure (in appropriate biological fluid): Budesonide and formoterol in 
plasma 

 

Equivalence based on: AUC and Cmax for budesonide and formoterol. The 90% 
confidence intervals for the geometric mean T/R ratios of AUC and Cmax should fall 
within the limits of 80.00–125.00%. 

______________________________________________________________________________ 

 


Clinical Endpoint Study 

The Agency recommends that applicants conduct the following BE study with a clinical endpoint 
for the lowest strength of the T and R products. 

 

7. Type of study: Clinical endpoint study 

Design: A randomized multiple-dose, placebo-controlled, parallel group design 
consisting of a 2-week run-in period followed by a 6-week treatment period of the 
placebo, T product, or R product 

Strength: 80/4.5 (budesonide 80 mcg and formoterol 4.5 mcg) 

Dose: 80/4.5, two inhalations twice daily

Program; National Institute of Health; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. 2007, Publication No. 07-4051 

 

• Exclusion criteria should, at minimum, include: 
a. Life-threatening asthma, defined as a history of asthma episodes(s) requiring 
intubation, and/or associated with hypercapnoea, respiratory arrest or 
hypoxic seizures, asthma-related syncopal episodes(s), or hospitalizations

b. Significant respiratory disease other than asthma (chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD), interstitial lung disease, etc.) 



c. Evidence or history of clinically significant disease or abnormality including 
congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled coronary 
artery disease, myocardial infarction, or cardiac dysrhythmia. In addition, 
historical or current evidence of significant hematologic, hepatic, 
neurologic, psychiatric, renal, or other diseases that, in the opinion of the 
investigator, would put the patient at risk through study participation, or 
would affect the study analyses if the disease exacerbated during the study 
d. Patients who required systemic corticosteroids (for any reason) within the 
past 4 weeks 
e. Hypersensitivity to any sympathomimetic drug (e.g., formoterol or 
albuterol) or any inhaled, intranasal, or systemic corticosteroid therapy 
f. Patients currently receiving ß-blockers 


 

• All spirometry should be conducted in accordance with American Thoracic 
Society standards. 
• The study should begin with a placebo run-in period at least 2 weeks in duration 
to wash out any pre-study corticosteroids/long-acting bronchodilators and to 
establish FEV1 baseline values. 
• The study protocol should include pre-specified definitions of asthma 
exacerbation, as well as pre-specified and appropriate escape criteria with 
consideration to patient safety. 
• The study protocol should provide a definition of compliant subjects (e.g., used at 
least 75% and no more than 125% of study drug doses) and specify how 
compliance will be verified (e.g., by the use of subject diaries). 
• To ensure adequate study sensitivity, the T and R products should both be 
statistically superior to placebo (p<0.05) with regard to the BE study primary 
endpoints. 
• It is the sponsor’s responsibility to enroll a sufficient number of subjects for the 
study to demonstrate BE of the T to the R product. 
• The start and stop date of concomitant medication use during the study should be 
provided in the data set in addition to the reason for the medication use. The 
sponsor should clearly explain whether the medication was used prior to baseline 
visit, during the study, or both. 
• All adverse events (AEs) should be reported, whether or not they are considered 
to be related to the treatment. The report of each AE should include date of onset, 
description of AE, severity, relation to study medication, action taken, outcome, 
and date of resolution. This information will assist FDA in determining whether 
the incidence and severity of adverse reactions is different between the T and R 
products. 


 

BE study endpoints: (i) Area under the serial FEV1-time curve calculated from time zero to 12 
hours (AUC0-12h) on the first day of the treatment, and (ii) FEV1 measured in the morning prior to 
the dosing of inhaled medications on the last day of the 6-week treatment. 

 

The above two primary endpoints should be baseline adjusted (change from baseline). An FEV1 
baseline is defined as the average of pre-dose FEV1 values of at least two time points measured 


in the morning of the first day of a 6-week treatment period. Sampling should correspond to the 
same time of day as used on the last day of a 6-week treatment. 

 

On the first day of the treatment, FEV1 should be determined at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 
hours post-dose. 

 

Equivalence based on: T/R ratio for the primary endpoints. The 90% confidence intervals for 
the T/R ratios for the primary endpoints should fall within the limits of 80.00-125.00%.

Additional information 

 

Formulation and Device 

 

FDA recommends that the T product be qualitatively (Q1)6 and quantitatively (Q2)7 the same 
as the R product, and be similar in shape and size to the R product. The T product should 
have a dose counter. The Agency encourages sponsors to submit a working model of the 
MDI to the Office of Generic Drugs prior to the ANDA submission, in order to ensure the 
eligibility of a T device under the 505(j) pathway. 

6 Q1 (qualitative sameness) means that the T product uses the same inactive ingredient(s) as the R product. 

7 Q2 (quantitative sameness) means that concentration of the inactive ingredient(s) used in the T product are within ±5% of those 
used in the R product.
