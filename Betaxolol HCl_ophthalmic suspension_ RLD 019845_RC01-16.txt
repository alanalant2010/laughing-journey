Additional comments regarding the BE study with clinical endpoint: 

 

1. The Office of Generic Drugs (OGD) recommends conducting a BE study with a clinical 
endpoint in the treatment of open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension comparing the 
test product versus the reference listed drug (RLD), each applied as one drop in both eyes 
two times daily at approximately 8:00 a.m., and 8:00 p.m. for 42 days (6 weeks). 


 

2. Inclusion criteria (the sponsor may add additional criteria): 
a. Male or nonpregnant females aged at least 18 years with chronic open-angle 
glaucoma or ocular hypertension in both eyes. 
b. Subject requires treatment of both eyes and is able to discontinue use of all ocular 
hypotensive medication(s) or switch ocular hypotensive medications and undergo an 
appropriate washout period. 
c. Adequate washout period prior to baseline of any ocular hypotensive medication (see 
Table 1). In order to minimize potential risk to patients due to intraocular pressure 
(IOP) elevations during the washout period, the investigator may choose to substitute 
a parasympathomimetic or carbonic anhydrase inhibitor in place of a 
sympathomimetic, alpha-agonist, beta-adrenergic blocking agent, or prostaglandin. 






All patients must have discontinued all ocular hypotensive medication for the 
minimum washout period provided in Table 1. 
d. Baseline (Day 0/hour 0) IOP = 22 mm Hg and = 34 mm Hg in each eye and any 
asymmetry of IOP between the eyes no greater than 5 mm Hg. 
e. Baseline best corrected visual acuity equivalent to 20/200 or better in each eye.

affecting IOP ( e.g., antihypertensive medication). 
k. Contact lenses. 
l. Ocular surgery. 





 

5. The recommended primary endpoint is the mean difference in IOP of both eyes between 
the two treatment groups at four time points, i.e., at approximately 8:00 a.m. (hour 0; 
before the morning drop) and 10:00 a.m. (hour 2) at the Day 14 (week 2) and Day 42 
(week 6) visits. 


 

6. The enrolled subjects should have mixture of light and dark colored irides similar in 
proportion to the U.S. population. 


 

7. The protocol should clearly define the per-protocol (PP) and safety populations. 
a. The accepted PP population used for BE evaluation includes all randomized subjects 
who meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria, instill a pre-specified proportion of the 






scheduled doses (e.g., 75% to 125%) of the assigned product for the specified 
duration of the study, do not miss the scheduled applications for more than 3 
consecutive days, and complete evaluations at Day 14 (week 2) and Day 42 (week 6) 
within the designated visit window (+/- 4 days) with no protocol violations that would 
affect the treatment evaluation. The protocol should specify how compliance will be 
verified (e.g., by the use of subject diaries). 
b. The safety population includes all randomized subjects who receive study product. 





 

8. Subjects whose condition worsens (e.g., IOP = 36 mm Hg in either eye) and require 
alternate or supplemental therapy for the treatment of their chronic open-angle glaucoma 
or ocular hypertension during the study should be discontinued, excluded from the PP 
population analysis, and provided with effective treatment. 


 

9. The start and stop dates of concomitant medication use during the study should be 
provided in the data set in addition to the reason for the medication use. The sponsor 
should clearly explain whether the medication was used prior to baseline visit, during the 
study, or both. 


 

10. All adverse events (AEs) should be reported, whether or not they are considered to be 
related to the treatment. The report of AEs should include date of onset, description of 
AE, severity, relation to study medication, action taken, outcome, and date of resolution. 
This information is needed to determine whether the incidence and severity of adverse 
reactions is different between the test product and RLD. 


 

11. Generally, a drug product intended for ophthalmic use shall contain the same inactive 
ingredients and in the same concentration as the RLD. For an ophthalmic drug product 
that differs from the RLD in preservative, buffer, substance to adjust tonicity, or 
thickening agent [as permitted by the chemistry, manufacturing and controls (CMC) 
regulations for ANDAs, 21 CFR 314.94(a)(9)(iv)], the regulation specifies that the 
applicant must identify and characterize the differences and provide information 
demonstrating that the differences do not affect the safety or efficacy of the proposed 
drug product. 


 

12. The method of randomization should be described in the protocol and the randomization 
schedule provided as a SAS data set in .xpt format (created using SAS XPORT). The 
FDA recommends that an independent third party generate and hold the randomization 
code throughout the conduct of the study in order to minimize bias. The sponsor may 
generate the randomization code if not involved in the packaging and labeling of the 
study medication. A sealed copy of the randomization scheme should be retained at the 
study site and should be available to FDA investigators at the time of site inspection to 
allow for verification of the treatment identity of each subject. 


 

13. Applicants should provide a detailed description of the masking procedure in the 
protocol. The packaging of the test and reference products should be similar in 
appearance to make differences in treatment less obvious to the subjects and to maintain 
adequate masking of evaluators. When possible, neither the subject nor the investigator 



should be able to identify the treatment. If the two treatments differ in appearance, 
evaluators should not be in the room whenever the treatment is taken out of the external 
packaging or the subject is dosed with a study treatment. 


 

14. Refer to 21 CFR 320.38, 320.63 and the Guidance for Industry: Handling and Retention 
of BA and BE Testing Samples regarding retention of study drug samples and 21 CFR 
320.36 for requirements for maintenance of records of BE testing. In addition, the 
investigators should follow the procedures of ICH E6, Good Clinical Practice: 
Consolidated Guideline, for retention of study records and data in order to conduct their 
studies in compliance with good laboratory practices and good clinical practices. 
Retention samples should be randomly selected from the drug supplies received prior to 
dispensing to subjects. Retention samples should not be returned to the sponsor at any 
time. 


 

15. It is the sponsor’s responsibility to enroll sufficient subjects for the study to demonstrate 
BE between the products. 


 

16. To establish BE, the limits of each two-sided 95% confidence interval of the treatment 
difference (test – reference) for mean IOP of both eyes (continuous variable) at all four 
follow-up points (i.e., at approximately 8:00 a.m. (hour 0; before the morning drop) and 
10:00 a.m. (hour 2) at the Day 14 (week 2) and Day 42 (week 6)) visits must be within ± 
1.5 mm Hg using the PP population for all time points measured and within ± 1.0 mm Hg 
using the PP population for at least three time points measured. 


 

17. The results of the primary endpoint at the four time points obtained by both the test 
product and RLD should be compared to the results that supported the approval of the 
RLD and any historical results in the literature. 


 

18. Study data should be submitted to the OGD in electronic format. All data should be 
submitted as a SAS .xpt file, created using SAS XPORT (not CPORT). 


a. Include a list of file names, a description of the content of each file, an 
explanation of the variables within each file, and a description of all variable 
codes (for example, for the treatment variable, A = TEST and B = 
REFERENCE. 

 

b. Provide a separate data set for demographic, vital sign, adverse event, 
disposition (including reason for discontinuation of treatment), concomitant 
medication, medical history, compliance, and comment variables. 

 

19. Applicants should provide a summary data set containing a separate line listing for each 
subject, if data exist. Use the following headings, if applicable: 
a. Study identifier 
b. Subject identifier 
c. Site identifier: study center
