 

Active ingredient: Bicalutamide 

 

Form/Route: Tablets/Oral 

 

Recommended studies: 2 studies 

 

1. Type of study: Fasting 
Design: Single-dose, two-way crossover in-vivo 

Strength: 50 mg 

Subjects: Normal healthy males, general population. 

Additional Comments: Female subjects should be excluded from the bioequivalence 
studies. Bicalutamide has a long terminal elimination half-life. Please 
ensure adequate washout periods between treatments in the crossover studies. You may 
also consider using a parallel study design due to bicalutamide’s long half-life. For long 
half-life drug products, an AUC truncated to 72 hours may be used in place of AUC0-t or 
AUC0-8.
