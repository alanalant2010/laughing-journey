Additional comments regarding the clinical endpoint BE study: 

 

1. The Office of Generic Drugs (OGD) recommends a clinical endpoint bioequivalence study in the 
treatment of moderate rosacea. Subjects are to be randomized to receive the generic Azelaic Acid 
topical gel, 15%, the reference listed drug (RLD), or placebo twice daily for 12 weeks. The 
primary endpoint is to be evaluated at the end of treatment (study Week 12). 




 

2. Inclusion Criteria (the sponsor may add additional criteria): 


a. Healthy male or nonpregnant female aged = 18 years with a clinical diagnosis of moderate 
facial rosacea, defined as the presence of: 


i. At least eight and not more than fifty inflammatory facial lesions (i.e., papules/pustules), 
AND 


ii. Persistent erythema, AND 


iii. Telangiectasia. 




b. Subject willing to minimize external factors that might trigger rosacea flare-ups (e.g., spicy 
foods, thermally hot foods and drinks, hot environments, prolonged sun exposure, strong 
winds and alcoholic beverages). 






 

3. Exclusion Criteria (the sponsor may add additional criteria): 


a. Pregnant or lactating or planning to become pregnant during the study period. 


b. Presence of any skin condition on the face that would interfere with the diagnosis or 
assessment of rosacea. 







c. Excessive facial hair (e.g. beards, sideburns, moustaches, etc.) that would interfere with 
diagnosis or assessment of rosacea. 


d. History of hypersensitivity or allergy to propylene glycol or any other component of the 
formulation. 


e. Use within 6 months prior to baseline of oral retinoids (e.g. Accutane®) or therapeutic 
vitamin A supplements of greater than 10,000 units/day (multivitamins are allowed). 


f. Use for less than 3 months prior to baseline of estrogens or oral contraceptives; use of such 
therapy must remain constant throughout the study. 


g. Use within 1 month prior to baseline of 1) topical retinoids to the face, 2) systemic antibiotics 
known to have an impact on the severity of facial rosacea (e.g., containing tetracycline and its 
derivatives, erythromycin and its derivatives, sulfamethoxazole, or trimethoprim), or 3) 
systemic corticosteroids. 


h. Use within 2 weeks prior to baseline of 1) topical corticosteroids, 2) topical antibiotics or 3) 
topical medications for rosacea (e.g., metronidazole, azelaic acid). 


i. Subjects with moderate or severe rhinophyma, dense telangiectases, or plaque-like facial 
edema. 


j. Ocular rosacea (e.g., conjunctivitis, blepharitis, or keratitis) of sufficient severity to require 
topical or systemic antibiotics. 






 

4. The protocol should include a list of the prescription and over-the-counter drug products that are 
prohibited during the study, such as: 


a. Any other topical products applied to the target site (e.g., metronidazole, topical antibiotics, 
topical steroids). 


b. Oral retinoids. 


c. Systemic (e.g., oral or injectable) antibiotics known to have an impact on the severity of 
facial rosacea (e.g., containing tetracycline, erythromycin, sulfamethoxazole, or trimethoprim 
or their derivatives). 


d. Systemic corticosteroid or immunosuppressive drugs. 


e. Antipruritics, including antihistamines, within 24 hours of study visits. 






 

5. Subjects should not apply moisturizers, new brands of make-up, creams, lotions, powders or any 
topical product other than the assigned treatment to the treatment area. Occlusive dressings or 
wrappings should be avoided in treatment areas. Subjects should minimize exposure to sunlight, 
including sunlamps, while using the product. Use of sunscreen products and protective clothing 
over treated areas is recommended when sun exposure cannot be avoided. 




 

6. Areas to be treated should be washed with a mild cleanser before application and patted dry with 
a soft towel. A thin layer of study treatment should be gently massaged into the affected areas on 
the face twice daily, in the morning and evening, for 12 weeks. Contact with the mouth, eyes and 
other mucous membranes should be avoided. The hands should be washed following application. 




 

7. The recommended primary endpoint of the study is the mean percent change from baseline to 
week 12 in the inflammatory (papules and pustules) lesion counts. The protocol should clearly 
define papules, pustules, and nodules. When counting facial lesions, it is important that all lesions 
be counted, including those present on the nose. Counts of nodules should be reported separately 
and not included in the inflammatory lesion counts. 




 

8. An Investigator’s Global Evaluation (IGE) should be evaluated as a secondary endpoint for the 
statistical analysis. The IGE should be a static scale, describing the extent of disease associated 
with each score. This scale should not be a reflection of treatment response, but should describe 
the condition at each visit. Therefore, no reference should be made to baseline in the evaluation. 





The scale should be dichotomized into "success" and "failure". "Success" should be defined either 
as a score consistent with clear or almost clear at the final visit.

4 

Severe

9. The protocol should clearly define the per-protocol (PP), modified intent-to-treat (mITT) and 
safety populations. 




 

10. The PP population includes all randomized subjects who met all inclusion/exclusion criteria, were 
compliant with the assigned study treatment, returned to the study site for the primary endpoint 
visit within the specified window (+/- 4 days) OR discontinued from the study as a treatment 
failure, and did not have any protocol violations. The PP population should be used for the 
bioequivalence evaluation of test vs. reference. The protocol should provide a definition of 
compliant subjects (e.g., used at least 75% and no more than 125% of study treatment doses) and 
specify how compliance will be verified (e.g., by the use of subject diaries). 




 

11. The mITT population includes all randomized subjects who met all inclusion/exclusion criteria, 
received study treatment, and returned for at least one post-baseline visit. The mITT population 
should be used to compare both test and reference products to placebo. 




 

12. The safety population includes all randomized subjects who received study treatment. 




 

13. Subjects who discontinued early from the study due to lack of treatment effect after completing at 
least eight weeks of treatment should be included in the mITT and PP population as treatment 
failures and the change in inflammatory lesion count from the baseline visit to the last completed 
visit prior to discontinuation due to lack of efficacy should be carried forward in the primary 
endpoint analysis. Subjects discontinued early for other reasons should be excluded from the PP 
population, but included in the mITT population, using Last Observation Carried Forward 
(LOCF). 




 

14. All adverse events (AEs) should be reported, whether or not they are considered to be related to 
the treatment. The report of AEs should include date of onset, description of the AE, severity, 
relation to study medication, action taken, outcome and date of resolution. This information is 
needed to determine if the incidence and severity of adverse reactions is different between the test 
product and RLD. 




 

15. If the inactive ingredients are different than those contained in the RLD or in significantly 
different amounts, then the sponsor is to clearly describe the differences and provide information 
to show that the differences will not affect the safety, efficacy and/or systemic or local 
availability of the drug. 




 

16. The method of randomization should be described in the protocol. It is recommended that an 
independent third party generate and hold the randomization code throughout the conduct of the 
study in order to minimize bias. The sponsor may generate the randomization code if not involved 





in the packaging and labeling of the study medication. A sealed copy of the randomization 
scheme should be retained at the study site and should be available to FDA investigators at the 
time of site inspection to allow for verification of the treatment identity of each subject. 




 

17. A detailed description of the blinding procedure is to be provided in the protocol. The packaging 
of the test, reference and placebo products should be similar in appearance to make differences in 
treatment less obvious to the subjects and to maintain adequate blinding of evaluators. When 
possible, neither the subject nor the investigator should be able to identify the treatment. The 
containers should not be opened by the subject at the study center. 




 

18. Please refer to 21 CFR 320.38, 320.63 and the Guidance for Industry, “Handling and Retention of 
BA and BE Testing Samples”, regarding retention of study drug samples and 21 CFR 320.36 for 
requirements for maintenance of records of bioequivalence testing. In addition, the investigators 
should follow the procedures of 21 CFR 58 and ICH E6, “Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated 
Guideline”, for retention of study records and data in order to conduct their studies in compliance 
with Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) and Good Clinical Practices (GCP). Retention samples 
should be randomly selected from the drug supplies received prior to dispensing to subjects. 
Retention samples should not be returned to the sponsor at any time. 




 

19. It is the sponsor's responsibility to enroll sufficient subjects for the study to demonstrate 
bioequivalence between the products. 




 

20. To establish bioequivalence for the primary endpoint, the 90% confidence interval for the 
test/reference ratio of mean percent change from baseline to week 12 in the inflammatory 
(papules and pustules) lesion counts must be contained within [0.80, 1.25] for a continuous 
variable, using the PP population. To establish bioequivalence for the secondary endpoint, the 
90% confidence interval of the difference in clinical success rate or success proportion between 
the test and reference product on the Investigator’s Global Evaluation (IGE) should be contained 
within [-0.20, +0.20] for a dichotomous variable, using the PP population. 




 

21. As a parameter for determining adequate study sensitivity, the test product and RLD should both 
be statistically superior to placebo (p<0.05, two-sided) for the primary endpoint (mean percent 
change from baseline), using the mITT study population and LOCF. 




 

22. The following Statistical Analysis Method is recommended for equivalence testing for a 
continuous variable: 




 

Equivalence Analysis for a Continuous Variable 

 

The compound hypothesis to be tested is: 

 

H0: µT / µR = .1 or µT / µR = .2 versus HA : .1 < µT / µR < .2 

 

Where µT = mean of test treatment, and µR = mean of reference treatment 

 

Typically, we reject H0 with a type I error a = 0.05 (two 1-sided tests), if the 90% confidence 
interval for the ratio of means between test and reference products (µT / µR) is contained within 
the interval [.1, .2], where .1 = 0.80 and .2 = 1.25. 

 

Rejection of the null hypothesis H0 supports the conclusion of equivalence of the two products. 

 


23. The following Statistical Analysis Method is recommended for equivalence testing for a 
dichotomous variable (success/failure): 




 

Equivalence Analysis for a Dichotomous Variable 

 

Based on the usual method used in OGD for binary outcomes, the 90% confidence interval for the 
difference in success proportions between test and reference treatment should be contained within 
[-0.20, +0.20] in order to establish equivalence.

We reject H0 if L = -0.20 and U = 0.20 

 

Rejection of the null hypothesis H0 supports the conclusion of equivalence of the two products. 

 

24. Study data should be submitted to the OGD in electronic format. 


a. A list of file names, with a simple description of the content of each file, should be included.

each variable in each of the SAS datasets (for example, Y=yes, N=no for analysis 
population). 


c. All SAS transport files should include .xpt as the file extension and should not be 
compressed. A simple SAS program to open the data transport files and SAS files should be
