2. Type of study: Fed 


Design: Single-dose, two-treatment, two-period crossover in vivo 

Strength: Naltrexone hydrochloride/bupropion hydrochloride 8 mg/90 mg × 2 tablets (16 
mg/180 mg) 

Subjects: Healthy males and nonpregnant females, general population 

 Additional comments: Same as comments above 


Analytes to measure (in appropriate biological fluid): Naltrexone and its active metabolite, 6-
beta-naltrexol, in plasma; bupropion and its active metabolites, hydroxybupropion, 
threohydrobupropion, and erythrohydrobupropion, in plasma 

 

Submit the metabolite data as supportive evidence of comparable therapeutic outcome. For the 
metabolite, the following data should be submitted: individual and mean concentrations, 
individual and mean pharmacokinetic parameters, and geometric means and ratios of means for 
AUC and Cmax. 

 

Bioequivalence based on (90% CI): Naltrexone and bupropion 

 

Waiver request of in vivo testing: Not applicable 

 

Dissolution test method and sampling times: The dissolution information for this drug 
product can be found on the FDA-Recommended Dissolution Methods Web site, available to the 
public at the following location: http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/dissolution/. 
Conduct comparative dissolution testing on 12 dosage units of the test and reference products. 
Specifications will be determined upon review of the abbreviated new drug application (ANDA). 

 

In addition to the method above, for modified-release products, dissolution profiles on 12 dosage 
units each of the test and reference products generated using U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP) 
Apparatus I at 100 rpm and/or Apparatus II at 50 rpm in at least three dissolution media (pH 1.2, 
4.5, and 6.8 buffer) should be submitted in the application. Agitation speeds may be increased, if 
appropriate. It is acceptable to add a small amount of surfactant, if necessary. Include early 
sampling times of 1, 2, and 4 hours and continue every 2 hours until at least 80% of the drug is 
released, to provide assurance against premature release of drug (dose dumping) from the 
formulation. Specifications will be determined upon review of the data submitted in the 
application. 

 

Due to a concern of dose dumping of drug from this drug product when taken with alcohol, the 
Agency currently requests that additional dissolution testing be conducted using various 
concentrations of ethanol in the dissolution medium, as follows: 

 

Testing conditions: 900 mL, 0.1 N HCl, USP apparatus 1 (basket) @75 rpm, with or without 
alcohol 

 

Test 1: 12 units tested according to the proposed method (with 0.1N HCl), with data 
collected every 15 minutes for a total of 2 hours 

 

Test 2: 12 units analyzed by substituting 5% (v/v) of test medium with Alcohol USP and 
data collection every 15 minutes for a total of 2 hours 

 

Test 3: 12 units analyzed by substituting 20% (v/v) of test medium with Alcohol USP and 
data collection every 15 minutes for a total of 2 hours 

 


Test 4: 12 units analyzed by substituting 40% (v/v) of test medium with Alcohol USP and 
data collection every 15 minutes for a total of 2 hours 

 

Both test and RLD products must be tested accordingly, and data must be provided on 
individual unit, means, range, and %CV.
