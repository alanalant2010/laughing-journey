 

Active ingredient: Atovaquone 

 

Form/Route: Tablets/Oral 

 

Recommended studies: 2 studies 

 

1. Type of study: Fasting 
Design: Single-dose, two-treatment, two-period crossover in-vivo 

Strength: 250 mg 

Subjects: Normal healthy males and females, general population. 

Additional Comments: You may also consider using a parallel study design due to 
atovaquone’s long half-life. For long half-life drug products, an AUC truncated to 72 
hours may be used in place of AUC0-t or AUC0-8.

Dissolution test method and sampling times: 

 

Please note that a Dissolution Methods Database is available to the public at the OGD website 
at http://www.fda.gov/cder/ogd/index.htm. Please find the dissolution information for this 
product at this website. Please conduct comparative dissolution testing on 12 dosage units each 
of all strengths of the test and reference products. Specifications will be determined upon review 
of the application. 

 

Atovaquone is known to be practically insoluble in both water and 0.1 M HCl (<0.0002 mg/mL 
at 25ºC). Use of conventional aqueous dissolution media with and without surfactant has been 
found unsuccessful and not reproducible in some laboratories working with atovaquone tablet 
products. If encountering the same difficulty, you may consider developing a dissolution method 


similar to the method available in the Dissolution Database. Although the use of the high 
alcoholic medium is not considered conventional, it has been found justifiable by the FDA for 
this drug substance. 

 

You may develop an alternate dissolution testing method for the drug product and submit the 
dissolution testing results when the application is filed.
