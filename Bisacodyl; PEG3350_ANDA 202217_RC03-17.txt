Recommended Studies: Request for Waiver of In vivo Bioequivalence Study Requirements 



Bioequivalence study recommendations: 

Bisacodyl Delayed-release Tablets are classified as a Category I (GRASE: generally recognized 
as safe and effective) over the counter (OTC) product. It is therefore eligible for a waiver of in-
vivo bioequivalence (BE) testing based on the OTC monograph and acceptable comparative 
dissolution testing provided that the test product is in the same dosage form and strength as the 
reference standard (RS). 



To qualify for a waiver of in vivo BE study requirements under 21 CFR 320.22(b)(3), the generic 
Polyethylene Glycol 3350, Potassium Chloride, Sodium Bicarbonate, and Sodium Chloride for 
Oral Solution products must contain the same active ingredients in the same concentration and 
dosage form as the RS and should not contain an inactive ingredient or other change in 
formulation from the RS that may significantly affect local availability for the product.
