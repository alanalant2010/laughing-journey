Life-threatening adverse events attributed to acute laryngeal dystonia have been reported 
following administration of a single dose of 30 mg aripiprazole to healthy volunteers in 
bioequivalence studies. Although such events have not been reported at doses lower than 30 
mg, because of the life-threatening nature of these events, and because the dose response 
relationship is not known for this event, the following safety precautions are recommended 
for healthy volunteer studies of aripiprazole at all doses: 

 

• Study protocols should specify standard procedures to diagnose and treat dystonic 
reactions should they occur. 


• Subjects younger than 45 years of age should be excluded. There appears to be an 
inverse linear relationship between age and the incidence of acute dystonic reactions. 
Adults under 35 years of age were reported to have a 15-fold higher rate of 
neuroleptic-induced dystonia compared to a group of patients 60-80 years of age. The 
occurrence of dystonias appears to be rare at ages of approximately 45 years and 
higher. 


• Protocols should include stringent drug screening procedures to ensure that subjects 
are free of illicit drugs at the time of administration of each study drug dose. 




This draft guidance, once finalized, will represent the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) 
current thinking on this topic. It does not create or confer any rights for or on any person and does 
not operate to bind FDA or the public. You can use an alternative approach if the approach satisfies 
the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations. If you want to discuss an alternative 
approach, contact the Office of Generic Drugs. 


• The screening interview should include specific questions to exclude subjects with a 
prior personal or family history of dystonic reactions to medications. Prospective 
study subjects should also be specifically questioned about prior neuroleptic drug 
exposures. 




 

Aripiprazole has been poorly tolerated by healthy volunteers in some bioequivalence studies, 
particularly at the 15 and 30 mg dose levels. In several cases, adverse events have resulted in 
a high incidence of dropouts. Adverse events in aripiprazole studies have included nausea, 
vomiting, dizziness, syncope, insomnia, headache, fatigue, hypotension, hot flashes, 
weakness, diaphoresis and confusion. To minimize the occurrence of adverse events, and to 
ensure the safety of healthy volunteer subjects in clinical trials of aripiprazole, the following 
is recommended: 

 

• Subjects should be monitored in-house for at least 3 days after dosing and until 
adverse events have resolved. 


• Subjects should be kept supine for at least 8 hours starting no longer than 15 minutes 
after each dose. 


• Subjects should be asked to use the bathroom soon before dosing. Subjects should be 
encouraged to use urinals or bedpans during the first 8 hours after dosing and at any 
time after dosing if the subject is experiencing adverse events such as nausea, 
dizziness or hypotension. If subjects do use the bathroom during the first 8 hours after 
dosing or while experiencing adverse events such as nausea, dizziness or hypotension, 
they should be assisted to and from the bathroom by study personnel. 


• At a minimum, routine 12-lead EKG’s should be performed at 3-5 hours after dosing 
and at 8-12 hours after dosing. Continuous EKG monitoring during those time periods 
may be considered as an alternative. 


• Vital signs monitoring should continue post dosing throughout the period that subjects 
are housed, commencing no later than 30 minutes following dosing. Vital signs 
should be monitored frequently (at least every 0.5-1 hour) for at least the first 8 hours 
after dosing and the first hour after subjects are allowed to rise from the supine 
position. 


• Prespecified limits should be defined for reporting adverse events related to vital signs 
(e.g. hypotension, bradycardia, etc.). Vital sign readings that meet these predefined 
limits should be reported as adverse events, even if they are not performed during a 
scheduled assessment (e.g. vital signs performed as part of an assessment of an 
adverse event). 


• The protocol should include standard procedures for the assessment and management 
of potential adverse events, including vital signs and EKG monitoring as appropriate 
for adverse events possibly associated with hypotension. 


• Women of childbearing potential should be enrolled only if they are using effective 
contraceptives. A negative pregnancy test is needed within 24 hours prior to each 
dose. These subjects should also be informed of the potential teratogenicity of the 
study drug as part of the informed consent process. Nursing women should also be 
excluded. 


• The protocol should include measures to prevent relative dehydration at the time of 
dosing, such as encouragement of water intake whenever possible prior to dosing. 
Consideration should be made to providing a standard meal just prior to the standard 
fasting period before dosing. 





• During the informed consent process, subjects should be advised of the high incidence 
of adverse events that have occurred in some healthy volunteer studies of aripiprazole. 




 

Aripiprazole has a long terminal elimination half-life. Please ensure adequate washout 
periods between treatments in the crossover studies. You may also consider using a parallel 
study design due to aripiprazole’s long half-life. For long half-life drug products, an AUC 
truncated to 72 hours may be used in place of AUC0-t or AUC0-inf. Please collect sufficient 
blood samples in the bioequivalence studies to adequately characterize the peak 
concentration (Cmax) and time to reach peak concentration (tmax).
