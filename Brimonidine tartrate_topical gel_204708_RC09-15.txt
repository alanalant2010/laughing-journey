Additional comments regarding the BE study with clinical endpoint: 

 

1. The Office of Generic Drugs (OGD) recommends conducting a BE study with clinical 
endpoint in the treatment of moderate-to-severe persistent (nontransient) facial erythema 
of rosacea. The study should compare the test product versus the reference listed drug 
(RLD) and placebo (vehicle) control, each administered by applying a pea-size amount of 
the assigned study treatment to each of the five areas of the face (forehead, chin, nose, 
each cheek)—avoiding the eyes and lips—once daily for 15 days. 


 

2. A placebo (vehicle) control arm is recommended to demonstrate that the test product and 
RLD are active and as a parameter to establish that the study is sufficiently sensitive to 
detect differences between products. 


 

3. Inclusion criteria (the sponsor may add additional criteria): 
a. Healthy male or nonpregnant females aged at least 18 years with a clinical diagnosis 
of facial rosacea. 
b. A clinical diagnosis of facial rosacea 






c. A Clinician Erythema Assessment (CEA) score of =3 at Screening and on 
Baseline/Day 1 prior to study drug application (per Table 1) 
d. A Patient Self Assessment (PSA) score of =3 at Screening and on Baseline/Day 1 
prior to study drug application (per Table 2) 
e. Subject’s willingness to minimize external factors that might trigger rosacea flare-ups 
(e.g., spicy foods, thermally hot foods and drinks, hot environments, prolonged sun 
exposure, strong winds, alcoholic beverages)

rosacea, or 6) topical treatment for acne 
o. Use within 1 week prior to baseline of niacin =500 mg per day 




 

5. The protocol should include a list of the prescription and over-the-counter drug products, 
procedures, and activities that are prohibited during the study, such as: 
a. Any other topical products applied to face 
b. Medicated soaps used on face 
c. Dermatologic or surgical procedure on face 
d. MAO inhibitors, barbiturates, opiates, sedatives, systemic anesthetics, alpha-agonists, 
cardiac glycosides, beta blockers, other antihypertensive agents, or brimonidine 
tartrate ophthalmic solution 
e. Systemic treatment for rosacea 
f. Systemic corticosteroids, systemic antibiotics, systemic immunomodulators, systemic 
anti-inflammatory agents, oral retinoids, or other systemic treatment for acne vulgaris 
g. Use of tanning booths, sunbathing, or excessive exposure to the sun 
h. Subjects should be instructed to wash their hands with soap and water before and 
after applying treatment and to avoid contact of the study product with the eye or lips. 





 

6. The CEA and PSA should be performed at the screening visit, the Baseline/Day 1 visit, 
and the End of Study/Day 15 visit. The screening visit and the Day 1 visit should be on 
separate days. During the screening visit, the CEA and PSA should be performed once. 
During the Day 1 and Day 15 visits, the CEA and PSA should be performed five times: 
prior to dosing and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 hours post-application. 


 

7. The recommended primary endpoint is the proportion of subjects with treatment success 
at Hour 3, 6, 9, and 12 post-application on Day 15, where treatment success is defined as 
a 2-grade improvement from pre-dose on Day 1 on both the CEA and PSA scales at each 
time point. 


 

8. The recommended secondary endpoint is the proportion of subjects with treatment 
success at Hour 3, 6, 9, and 12 post-application on Day 1, where treatment success is 
defined as a 2-grade improvement from pre-dose on Day 1 on both the CEA and PSA 
scales at each time point. 



 

9. The protocol should clearly define the per-protocol (PP), modified intent-to-treat (mITT), 
and safety populations. 
a. The accepted PP population used for BE evaluation includes all randomized subjects 
who met all inclusion/exclusion criteria, applied a pre-specified proportion of the 
scheduled doses (e.g., 75% to 125%) of the assigned product for the specified 
duration of the study, did not miss the scheduled applications for more than 1 
consecutive day, and completed the evaluation within the designated visit window 
(+/- 2 days) with no protocol violations that would affect the treatment evaluation. 
The protocol should specify how compliance will be verified, e.g., by the use of 
subject diaries. 
b. The mITT population includes all randomized subjects who applied at least one dose 
of assigned product. 
c. The safety population includes all randomized subjects who received study product. 


 

10. Subjects who are discontinued early from the study due to insufficient or lack of 
treatment effect should be included in the PP population as treatment failures. Subjects 
discontinued early for other reasons should be excluded from the PP population, but 
included in the mITT population, using Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF). 


 

11. The start and stop dates of concomitant medication use during the study should be 
provided in the data set in addition to the reason for the medication use. The sponsor 
should clearly explain whether the medication was used prior to Baseline visit, during the 
study, or both. 


 

12. All adverse events (AEs) should be reported, whether or not they are considered to be 
related to the treatment. The report of AEs should include date of onset, description of 
AE, severity, relation to study medication, action taken, outcome, and date of resolution. 
This information is relevant to FDA’s determination of whether the incidence and 
severity of adverse reactions is different between the test product and RLD. 


 

13. If the inactive ingredients of the test product are different from those contained in the 
RLD or in significantly different amounts, the sponsor must clearly describe the 
differences and provide information to show that the differences will not affect the safety, 
efficacy, and/or systemic or local availability of the drug. 


 

14. The method of randomization should be described in the protocol and the randomization 
schedule provided as a SAS data set in .xpt format (created using SAS XPORT). The 
Agency recommends that an independent third party generate and hold the randomization 
code throughout the conduct of the study in order to minimize bias. The sponsor may 
generate the randomization code if not involved in the packaging and labeling of the 
study medication. A sealed copy of the randomization scheme should be retained at the 
study site and should be available to FDA investigators at the time of the site inspection 
to allow for verification of the treatment identity of each subject. 


 


15. A detailed description of the blinding procedure is to be provided in the protocol. The 
packaging of the test, reference, and placebo products should be similar in appearance to 
make differences in treatment less obvious to the subjects and to maintain adequate 
blinding of evaluators. When possible, neither the subject nor the investigator should be 
able to identify the treatment. The containers should not be opened by the subject at the 
study center. 


 

16. Refer to 21 CFR 320.38, 320.63 and the guidance for industry Handling and Retention of 
BA and BE Testing Samples regarding retention of study drug samples and 21 CFR 
320.36 for requirements for maintenance of records of BE testing. In addition, the 
investigators should follow the procedures of 21 CFR 58 and ICH E6, Good Clinical 
Practice: Consolidated Guideline, for retention of study records and data in order to 
conduct their studies in compliance with Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) and Good 
Clinical Practices (GCP). Retention samples should be randomly selected from the drug 
supplies received prior to dispensing to subjects. Retention samples should not be 
returned to the sponsor at any time. 


 

17. It is the sponsor’s responsibility to enroll sufficient subjects for the study to demonstrate 
bioequivalence between the products. 


 

18. To establish bioequivalence for a dichotomous endpoint, FDA recommends applicants 
test the following compound hypotheses using the per protocol population: 
HO: pT – pR = .1 or pT – pR = .2 versus HA: .1 < pT – pR < .2 
where pT = the success rate of the primary endpoint for the treatment group, and 
pR = the success rate of the primary endpoint for the reference group. 
The null hypothesis, HO, is rejected with a type I error (a) of 0.05 (two one-sided tests) if 
the estimated 90% confidence interval for the difference of the success rates between test 
and reference products (pT – pR) is contained within the interval [. 1, . 2], where . 1 = -
0.20 and . 2 = 0.20. Rejection of the null hypothesis supports the conclusion of 
equivalence of the two products. 


 

19. To establish sensitivity within the study for either a dichotomous or continuous primary 
endpoint, the test and reference products should both be statistically superior to the 
placebo. Conduct an appropriate inferential test with a type I error (a) of 0.05, using the 
mITT population and the primary endpoint. 


 

20. Study data should be submitted to OGD in electronic format. All data should be 
submitted as a SAS .xpt file, created using SAS XPORT (not CPORT). 
a. Include a list of file names, a description of the content of each file, an explanation 
of the variables within each file, and a description of all variable codes (for example, 
for the treatment variable, A = TEST and B = RLD). 
b. Provide a SAS program to open the SAS .xpt files. 



c. Provide two primary data sets, one with No Last Observation Carried Forward (NO-
LOCF - pure data set) and one with the Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF - 
modified data set). 
d. Provide a separate data set for demographic, vital sign, adverse event, disposition 
(including reason for discontinuation of treatment), concomitant medication, medical 
history, compliance, and comment variables. 


 

21. Sponsors should provide a summary data set that contains a separate line listing for each 
subject (if data exist) using the following headings, if applicable: 
a. Study identifier
