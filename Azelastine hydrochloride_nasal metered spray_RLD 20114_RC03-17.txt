In Vitro Studies 



FDA recommends that applicants conduct the following in vitro BE studies on samples from 
each of three or more batches of the T product and three or more batches of the R product, with 
no fewer than 10 units from each batch. A single batch of solution can be split-filled into three 
equal size sub-lots of product. The sub-lots should be prepared from three different batches of 
the same device (pump and actuator) components. 



1.Single actuation content
2.Droplet size distribution by laser diffraction
3.Drug in small particles/droplets
4.Spray pattern
5.Plume geometry
6.Priming and repriming




Additional Comments: Refer to the product-specific guidance for Fluticasone Propionate Nasal 
Spray Metered1 for recommendations on design and equivalence criteria for the aforementioned 
in vitro BE studies, and general recommendations on the conduct of the in vitro BE studies and 
data submission.

Additional Information 



Formulation: 

FDA recommends that the T product be qualitatively (Q1)2 and quantitatively (Q2)3 the same as 
the R product. 

2 Q1 (qualitative sameness) means that the T product uses the same inactive ingredient(s) as the R product. 

3 Q2 (quantitative sameness) means that concentrations of the inactive ingredient(s) used in the T product are within 
±5% of those used in the R product. 



Device: 

FDA recommends that the T product deliver the same number of doses as the R product, and be 
similar in shape, size, and external operating principles to ensure substitutability with the R 
product without additional need to retrain patients upon the use of the generic product.
