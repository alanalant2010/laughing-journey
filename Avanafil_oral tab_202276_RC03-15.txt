Design: Single-dose, two-way crossover in vivo 

Strength: 200 mg 

Subjects: Healthy males, general population 

Additional comments: Coadministration of avanafil with any form of organic nitrate is

Analytes to measure (in appropriate biological fluid): Avanafil in plasma 

 

Bioequivalence based on (90% CI): Avanafil 

 

Waiver request of in vivo testing: 50 mg and 100 mg based on (i) acceptable bioequivalence 
studies on the 200 mg strength, (ii) acceptable in vitro dissolution testing of all strengths, and 
(iii) proportional similarity of the formulations across all strengths. 

 

Dissolution test method and sampling times: The dissolution information for this drug 
product can be found on the FDA-Recommended Dissolution Methods website available to the 
public at the following location: http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/dissolution/. 
Conduct comparative dissolution testing on 12 dosage units each of all strengths of the test and 
reference products. Specifications will be determined upon review of the abbreviated new drug 
application (ANDA).
