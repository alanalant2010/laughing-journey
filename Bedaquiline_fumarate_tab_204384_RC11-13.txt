Information Regarding Long Half-Life Drugs 

For an oral immediate release product with a long elimination half-life drug (>24 hrs), applicants 
can conduct a single-dose, crossover study, provided an adequate washout period is used. If the 
crossover study is problematic, BE applicants can use a BE study with a parallel design. For 


either a crossover or parallel study, sample collection time should be adequate to ensure 
completion of gastrointestinal transit of the drug product and absorption of the drug substance 
(which usually occurs within approximately 2 to 3 days). Cmax and a suitable truncated AUC 
can be used to characterize peak and total drug exposure, respectively. For drugs that 
demonstrate low intra-subject variability in distribution and clearance, an AUC truncated at 72 
hour (AUC0-72hr) can be used in place of AUC0-t or AUC0-inf. For drugs demonstrating high 
intra-subject variability in distribution and/or clearance, AUC truncation should not be used.
