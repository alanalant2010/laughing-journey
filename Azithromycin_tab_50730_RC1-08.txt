Analytes to measure: Azithromycin 

 

Bioequivalence based on (90% CI): Azithromycin 

 

Waiver request of in-vivo testing*: 250 mg and 500 mg based on (i) acceptable bioequivalence 

studies on the 600 mg strength, (ii) proportionally similar across all strengths, and (iii) 

acceptable in vitro dissolution testing of all strengths. 

 

* Since Azithromycin Tablets, 250 mg, 500 mg, and 600 mg, are the subject of three separate New Drug 
Applications (NDA’s), three separate Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDA’s) must be submitted. 
You may request a waiver of in vivo bioequivalence testing of the 250 mg and the 500 mg strengths if you 
meet the criteria. In addition, please cross-reference the in vivo bioequivalence studies conducted on the 
higher strength along with your waiver request. Please refer to the Guidance for Industry, Variations in 
Drug Products that May Be Included in a Single ANDA located at: http://www.fda.gov/cder/guidance. 

 

Dissolution test method and sampling times: 

 

Please note that a Dissolution Methods Database is available to the public at the OGD website at 
http://www.fda.gov/cder/ogd/index.htm. Please find the dissolution information for this product at this 
website. Please conduct comparative dissolution testing on 12 dosage units each of all strengths of the test 
and reference products. Specifications will be determined upon review of the application.
