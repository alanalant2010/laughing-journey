I. In Vitro option: 


 

To qualify for the in vitro option for this drug product pursuant to 21 CFR 320.24(b)(6), under 
which “[a]ny other approach deemed adequate by FDA to measure bioavailability or establish 
bioequivalence” may be acceptable for determining the bioavailability or bioequivalence (BE) of 
a drug product, all of the following criteria must be met: 

i. Equivalent comparative qualitative and quantitative (Q1/Q2) characterization. 
ii. Equivalent comparative physicochemical and microstructural (Q3) characterization of 
comparable pH, specific gravity, emulsion globule size distribution (e.g., evaluated 
microscopically, if possible) and viscosity profiles with measurements made not only to 
determine the linear viscoelastic response but also to investigate any nonlinear viscosity 
behavior over a range of shear rates. We recommend to perform these comparative 
studies on at least three lots of the test product, and (as available) three lots of the RLD 
product. 
iii. Equivalent comparative dosage form performance characterization in vitro, using the USP 
<1724> compendial In Vitro Release Test (IVRT) method. We recommend that the IVRT 
method be validated to demonstrate its reproducibility and discrimination sensitivity. 
Discrimination sensitivity may be validated by testing of the 5% benzyl alcohol lotion, 
compared with altered (e.g. 2.5% and 7.5%) benzyl alcohol lotions of otherwise 
comparable composition, to demonstrate the sensitivity of the IVRT method to 
monitoring the proportionality of the release rates as a function of benzyl alcohol 
concentration, and to demonstrate the ability of the IVRT method to detect inequivalence 
of the altered formulations’ drug release rates to that measured for the 5% benzyl alcohol 
lotion, using the statistical methodology described in <1724>. 
iv. Equivalent comparative dosage form performance characterization ex vivo in Pediculus 
humanus capitis (head lice), using an appropriate pediculicide hair tuft assay with 
relevant controls (e.g., similar to Strycharz et al., Journal of Medical Entomology 
45(1):75-81. 2008). 






 

If the generic drug product has different inactive ingredients compared to the RLD, then the 

Office of Generic Drugs requests a clinical endpoint study to determine bioequivalence between 
the products.

Additional comments regarding the BE study with clinical endpoint: 

 

1. The Office of Generic Drugs (OGD) recommends conducting a bioequivalence study 
with a clinical endpoint in the treatment of active infestation with Pediculus humanus 
capitis (head lice and their ova) comparing the test product versus the reference listed 
drug (RLD) and vehicle control, applied at one time at home on study Day 1 by the 
subject or their caregiver and one time at home again on Day 8. The primary endpoint 
is the proportion of subjects with treatment success, defined as absence of live head 
lice when examined 14 days after the last application of study treatment (study Day 
22). Four site visits, each including a visual examination for the presence of live lice by 
the evaluator with the aid of a 5X lighted magnifier and a wide tooth comb to part and 
separate the subject’s hair, are recommended as follows: Visit 1 (study Day 1; before 
home treatment #1), Visit 2 (study Day 2; one day after home treatment #1), Visit 3 
(study Day 9; one day after home treatment #2) and Visit 4 (study Day 22; 14 days 
after home treatment #2). 

 

2. A placebo control arm (vehicle of test product) is recommended to demonstrate that the 
test product and RLD are active and as a parameter to establish that the study is 
sufficiently sensitive to detect differences between products. 

 

3. Inclusion Criteria (the sponsor may add additional criteria): 

a. Healthy males or nonpregnant females aged 6 months to 60 years, inclusive with an 
active infestation of Pediculus humanus capitis (human head lice) with at least 
three “live lice” (defined as live adults and/or nymphs) at baseline. 


b. Subject and/or parent/guardian agree that the subject will not use any other form of 
lice treatment during the duration of the study. 

 

4. Exclusion Criteria (the sponsor may add additional criteria): 

a. Females who are pregnant, breast feeding, or who wish to become pregnant during 
the study period. 

b. Known allergy or hypersensitivity to benzyl alcohol or any component of the test 
product or RLD. 

c. Scalp condition that could make it difficult to evaluate the extent and severity of an 
infestation or that would present a problem in the evaluation of response to therapy 
(e.g. psoriatic scalp lesions, extensive seborrheic dermatitis). 

d. Known history of irritation or sensitivity to pediculicides or hair care products. 

e. Within 4 weeks of randomization treatment with a pediculicide. 

f. Subject with very short (shaved) hair, subject who plans to shave head during the 
study, and/or subject who used any hair dye, bleaches, hair straightening or 
permanent wave solution on the hair within 14 days of randomization. 

 

5. The primary endpoint is the proportion of subjects in the Per Protocol (PP) population 
in each treatment group with treatment success (i.e., absence of live head lice) when 
examined 14 days after the last application of study treatment (study Day 22; 14 days 
after home treatment #2). 

 

6. Subjects who do not respond to therapy (i.e., if any live head lice are noted during Visit 
2, 3, or 4) will receive standard therapy (i.e., early escape clause). Such subjects will be 
treated as failures of therapy in the final analysis. Subjects with no live lice should be 
provided with sufficient study drug for the second treatment (e.g. 7 days after the first 
treatment.) 

 

7. Provide oral and written instructions to the subject and/or parent/guardian as follows: 

a. Cover face and eyes with a towel and keep eyes closed tightly. Apply the lotion 
directly to the dry scalp and rub into hair to completely cover the entire scalp and 
all scalp hair. When applying the lotion, pay particular attention to the back of the 
neck and behind the ears. Follow the Usage Guideline in Table 1 for the amount of 
lotion needed per application:

b. Massage the lotion into hair and scalp. Leave the lotion on for 10 minutes; then 
thoroughly rinse off with water. 

c. Repeat application after 7 days after the first application. 

d. Avoid eye exposure. If lotion comes in contact with the eyes, flush them 
immediately with water. If irritation persists, consult a physician. 

e. Anyone applying the lotion should wash their hands immediately after the 
application process is complete. 

f. Keep out of reach of children. 

 

8. Provide details in the protocol regarding the procedures to be taken to decrease 
reinfestation, such as the examination of household members of the enrolled subjects 
for head lice (and treatment of such household members found to be infested), 
decontamination of clothing and bed linen that may have been contaminated by the 
infested individual prior to treatment and disinfection of combs and brushed used by 
the infected patient. 

 

9. The protocol should clearly define the per-protocol (PP), modified intent-to-treat 
(mITT) and safety populations. 

a. The PP population includes all randomized subjects who met all 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, applied the assigned product as instructed and 
completed the evaluation within the designated visit window (+/- 2 days) with no 
protocol violations that would affect the treatment evaluation. The protocol should 
specify how compliance will be verified, e.g., by the use of subject diaries, and the 
protocol violations that would affect the treatment evaluation. 

b. The mITT population includes all randomized subjects who met all 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, received the assigned study product and returned for at 
least one post-baseline evaluation visit. 

c. The safety population includes all randomized subjects who received study 
product. 

 

10. It is important to ensure that evaluators (experienced professionals) conduct a thorough 
and consistent evaluation for the presence of lice. This information could be captured 
as the time spent by the evaluator to assess for the presence of lice. 

 

11. Subjects with live lice noted at Visits 2, 3, or 4 and any subjects whose condition 
worsens and require alternate or supplemental therapy for the treatment of their 
Pediculus humanus capitis during the study should be discontinued, included in the PP 
population analysis as treatment failures, and provided with effective treatment. 
Subjects discontinued early for other reasons should be excluded from the PP 
population, but included in the mITT population, using Last Observation Carried 
Forward (LOCF). 

 


12. The start and stop date of concomitant medication use during the study should be 
provided in the data set in addition to the reason for the medication use. The sponsor 
should clearly explain whether the medication was used prior to baseline visit, during 
the study, or both. 

 

13. All adverse events (AEs) should be reported, whether or not they are considered to be 
related to the treatment. The report of AEs should include date of onset, description of 
the AE, severity, relation to study medication, action taken, outcome and date of 
resolution. 

 

14. Application site reactions such as irritation, erythema, pyoderma, excoriation, edema, 
anesthesia, pain, and ocular irritation are to be recorded at each visit to allow a 
comparison between treatment groups. Local safety evaluation should be performed on 
a four-point scale (0 (absent), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), and 3 (severe)) for five 
categories: pruritus, erythema, pyoderma, and excoriation. A descriptive analysis 
comparing the application site reactions for each treatment group is recommended. It is 
important to ensure that the test product is not worse than the reference product with 
regard to the expected and unexpected application site reactions. 

 

15. If the inactive ingredients are different than those contained in the RLD or present in 
significantly different amounts, then the sponsor is to clearly describe the differences 
and provide information to show that the differences will not affect the safety, efficacy 
and/or systemic or local availability of the drug. 

 

16. The quantitative information of inactive ingredients of the vehicle/placebo control 
should be provided. 

 

17. The method of randomization should be described in the protocol. It is recommended 
that an independent third party generate and hold the randomization code throughout 
the conduct of the study in order to minimize bias. The sponsor may generate the 
randomization code if not involved in the packaging and labeling of the study 
medication. A sealed copy of the randomization scheme should be retained at the study 
site and should be available to FDA investigators at the time of site inspection to allow 
for verification of the treatment identity of each subject. 

 

18. A detailed description of the blinding procedure is to be provided in the protocol. The 
packaging of the test, reference and placebo products should be similar in appearance 
to make differences in treatment less obvious to the subjects and to maintain adequate 
blinding of evaluators. When possible, neither the subject nor the investigator should 
be able to identify the treatment. The containers should not be opened by the subject at 
the study center. 

 

19. Please refer to 21 CFR 320.38, 320.63 and the Guidance for Industry, “Handling and 
Retention of BA and BE Testing Samples”, regarding retention of study drug samples 
and 21 CFR 320.36 for requirements for maintenance of records of bioequivalence 
testing. In addition, the investigators should follow the procedures of ICH E6, “Good 


Clinical Practice: Consolidated Guideline”, for retention of study records and data in 
order to conduct their studies in compliance with Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) 
and Good Clinical Practices (GCP). Retention samples should be randomly selected 
from the drug supplies received prior to dispensing to subjects. Retention samples 
should not be returned to the sponsor at any time. 

 

20. It is the sponsor's responsibility to enroll sufficient subjects for the study to 
demonstrate bioequivalence between the products. 

 

21. To establish bioequivalence, the 90% confidence interval of the test - reference 
difference between products for the primary endpoint (success proportion) must be 
contained within [-0.20, +0.20] for dichotomous variables (success versus failure), 
using the PP population. 

 

22. As a parameter for determining adequate study sensitivity, the test product and RLD 
should both be statistically superior to placebo control (p < 0.05, two-sided) for the 
primary endpoint using the mITT population and LOCF. 

 

23. The following Statistical Analysis Method is recommended for equivalence testing 
for a dichotomous variable (success/failure): 

 

Equivalence Analysis 

 

Based on the usual method used in OGD for binary outcomes, the 90% confidence 
interval for the difference in success proportions between test and reference 
treatment must be contained within [-0.20, +0.20] in order to establish equivalence.

The 90% confidence interval for the difference in proportions between test and 
reference was calculated as follows, using Yates’ correction:

We reject H0 if L = -0.20 and U = 0.20 

 

Rejection of the null hypothesis H0 supports the conclusion of equivalence of the 
two products. 

 

24. The Case Report Form (CRF) should clearly document the specific reason for use of 
this product, e.g. new infestation of lice or failure to respond adequately to other 
topical prescription or over-the counter treatments. Study data should be submitted to 
the OGD in electronic format. 

a. A list of file names, with a simple description of the content of each file, should 
be included. Such a list should include an explanation of the variables included 
in each of the data sets. 

b. Please provide a “pdf” document with a detailed description of the codes that are 
used for each variable in each of the SAS datasets (for example, Y=yes, N=no for 
analysis population). 

c. SAS transport files, covering all variables collected in the Case Report Forms 
(CRFs) per subject, should include .xpt as the file extension and should not be 
compressed. A simple SAS program to open the data transport files and SAS 
files should be included. 

d. Primary data sets should consist of two data sets: No Last Observation Carried 
Forward (NO-LOCF-pure data set) and Last Observation Carried Forward 
(LOCF- modified data set). 

e. Please provide a separate dataset for variables such as demographics, disease 
severity (IGA), vital signs, adverse events, disposition (including reason for 
discontinuation of treatment,) concomitant medications, medical history, 
compliance and comments, etc. 

 

25. Please provide a summary dataset containing a separate line listing for each subject 
(if data exist) using the following headings, if applicable: 

a. Study identifier
