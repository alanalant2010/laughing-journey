 

Active ingredient: Atorvastatin, Ezetimibe 

 

Form/Route: Tablet/Oral 

 

Recommended studies: 2 studies 

 

1. Type of study: Fasting 


Design: Single dose, two way crossover, in vivo 

Strength: 80 mg (base); 10 mg 

Subjects: Healthy males and non-pregnant females, general population. 

Additional Comments: 1. Females should practice abstention or contraception during the 
study. 2. Considering the high variability of Atorvastatin, applicants may consider using a 
reference-scaled average bioequivalence approach for this drug product. If this approach 
is used, please provide evidence of high variability in the bioequivalence parameters of 
AUC and/or Cmax (i.e., within-subject variability > 30%). For general information on 
this approach, please refer to the Individual Product Bioequivalence Recommendations 
Guidance on Progesterone Capsules. 3. Study subjects should swallow tablets whole. Do 
not crush, dissolve or chew tablets. 4. Statins may cause fetal harm when administered to 
a pregnant woman. Because the product contains atorvastatin, it should not be 
administered to women of childbearing potential. Also these female subjects should be 
informed of the potential hazards. If the woman becomes pregnant while taking this 
product, discontinue it immediately. Because of the potential for adverse reactions in 
nursing infants, women taking these products should not breast-feed.

Analytes to measure (in appropriate biological fluid): Atorvastatin and the metabolites, 
ortho- and para-hydroxylated atorvastatin, as well as Ezetimibe (unconjugated) and total 
ezetimibe (ezetimibe + ezetimibe glucuronide) in plasma 


 

Bioequivalence based on (90% CI): Atorvastatin and Ezetimibe (unconjugated) and total 
ezetimibe (ezetimibe + ezetimibe glucuronide). 

 

Please submit the atorvastatin metabolite data as supportive evidence of comparable therapeutic 
outcome. For the metabolite, submit the following data: individual and mean concentrations, 
individual and mean pharmacokinetic parameters, and geometric means and ratios of means for 
AUC and Cmax. 

 

Waiver request of in vivo testing: Atorvastatin; Ezetimibe, i) 40 mg (base); 10 mg, ii) 20 mg 
(base); 10 mg and iii) 10 mg (base). 10 mg strengths based on (1) acceptable bioequivalence 
study on the 80 mg (base); 10 mg strength, (2) acceptable in vitro dissolution testing of all 
strengths, and (3) proportional similarity of the formulations across all strengths. 

 

Dissolution test method and sampling times: 

 

Please note that a Dissolution Methods Database is available to the public at the OGD website 
at http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/dissolution/. Please find the dissolution 
information for this product at this website. Please conduct comparative dissolution testing on 12 
dosage units each of all strengths of the test and reference products. Specifications will be 
determined upon review of the application.
