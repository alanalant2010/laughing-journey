current or prior diagnosis of bulimia or anorexia nervosa, taken a monoamine oxidase 
(MAO) inhibitor within 14 days prior to dosing, allergic to any active or inactive 
ingredient in the study medications or undergoing abrupt discontinuation of alcohol or 
sedatives (including benzodiazepines). Prohibit the concomitant administration of drug 
products per the currently approved RLD labeling, e.g., any MAO inhibitor, 
antipsychotic, antidepressant, theophylline, systemic steroid and any other drug product 
containing bupropion hydrochloride or bupropion hydrobromide.

2. Type of study: Fed 

Design: Single-dose, two-treatment, two-period crossover in vivo 

Strength: 522 mg

Analytes to measure (in appropriate biological fluid): Bupropion and its active metabolites, 
hydroxybupropion, threohydrobupropion, and erythrohydrobupropion, in plasma. 

 

Please submit the metabolites data as supportive evidence of comparable therapeutic outcome. 
For the metabolites, the following data should be submitted: individual and mean concentrations, 
individual and mean pharmacokinetic parameters, and geometric means and ratios of means for 
AUC and Cmax. 

 


Bioequivalence based on (90% CI): Bupropion 

 

Approval of other strength(s): 174 mg and 348 mg based on (i) acceptable bioequivalence 
studies on the 522 mg strength, (ii) proportionally similar across all strengths, and (iii) acceptable 
in vitro dissolution testing of all strengths. 

 

Dissolution test method and sampling times: 

Please note that a Dissolution Methods Database is available to the public at the OGD website 
at http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/dissolution/. Please find the dissolution 
information for this product at this website. Please conduct comparative dissolution testing on 12 
dosage units each of all strengths of the test and reference products. Specifications will be 
determined upon review of the application. 

 

In addition to the method above, for modified release products, dissolution profiles on 12 dosage 
units each of test and reference products generated using USP Apparatus I at 100 rpm and/or 
Apparatus II at 50 rpm in at least three dissolution media (pH 1.2, 4.5 and 6.8 buffer) should be 
submitted in the application. Agitation speeds may have to be increased if appropriate. It is 
acceptable to add a small amount of surfactant, if necessary. Please include early sampling times 
of 1, 2, and 4 hours and continue every 2 hours until at least 80% of the drug is released, to 
provide assurance against premature release of drug (dose dumping) from the formulation. 
Specifications will be determined upon review of the data submitted in the application. 

 

Due to concerns of dose dumping from this drug product when taken with alcohol, please 
conduct additional dissolution testing using various concentrations of ethanol in the dissolution 
medium, as follows: 

 

Testing Conditions: 900 mL, 0.1 N HCl, USP apparatus 1 (baskets) @ 75 rpm, with or without 
alcohol: 

 

Test 1: 12 units tested according to the proposed method (with 0.1 N HCl), with data 
collected every 15 minutes for a total of 2 hours. 

 

Test 2: 12 units tested by substituting 5% (v/v) of test medium with Alcohol USP, and 
data collection every 15 minutes for a total of 2 hours. 

 

Test 3: 12 units tested by substituting 20% (v/v) of test medium with Alcohol USP, and 
data collection every 15 minutes for a total of 2 hours. 

 

Test 4: 12 units tested by substituting 40% (v/v) of test medium with Alcohol USP, and 
data collection every 15 minutes for a total of 2 hours. 

 

Both test and RLD products must be tested accordingly and data must be provided on individual 
unit, means, range and %CV on all strengths.
