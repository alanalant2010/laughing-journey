 

Active ingredient: Budesonide 

 

Form/Route: Suspension/Inhalation 

 

Recommended studies: 

 

1. Testing Requirements for the Highest Strength (1 mg/2 mL) Product: 




The generic budesonide suspension/inhalation product must be qualitatively (Q1) and 
quantitatively (Q2) the same as the reference listed drug product (RLD). 

 

Option A. In Vitro Bioequivalence Studies Alone: 

 

The following in vitro comparative tests are recommended. Pari LC Plus Nebulizer/Pari 
Master compressor system is recommended for those tests requiring nebulization. The tests 
include: 

 

1) Sameness of polymorphic form of the drug substance based on X-ray diffraction. 

 

2) Sameness of shape (crystalline habit) of the drug substance. 

 

3) Comparative Unit Dose Content (UDC) of drug in the ampules. 

 

4) Comparative Mean Nebulization Time (MNT) and Mean Delivered Dose (MDD): The 
test should be conducted at the mouthpiece (% nominal dose) at the labeled flow rate of 
5.5 L/min through such time that mist is no longer coming out of the mouthpiece. 

 

5) Comparative drug particle and agglomerate Particle Size Distribution (PSD) in the 
suspension (in the ampoule): The PSD determination should be based on a validated 
method. Validation should demonstrate method sensitivity to drug particle size over the 
expected size range in the suspension. 

 

6) Comparative drug particle and agglomerate PSD in the nebulized aerosol: Recommended 
method for this test is the aerodynamic particle size distribution (APSD) of the nebulized 
aerosol based on Apparatus 5 (USP <601>) at a flow rate of 15 L/min through the 
Apparatus. We recommend the study be conducted based on USP <1601> using the Pari 
LC Plus Nebulizer/Pari Master compressor system. The amount of drug deposited on the 
induction port, the seven stages of the cascade impactor, and the sum of the back-up filter 
and micro-orifice collector (MOC) should be submitted.


7) Comparative aqueous droplet size distribution of the nebulized aerosol by a Laser 
diffraction method. 

 

Option B. Combination of In Vitro and In Vivo Bioequivalence Studies: 

 

1) Tests should include all described above in 1. Option A, with the exception of 
comparative drug particle and agglomerate PSD in the nebulized aerosol referred 
in 1. Option A. 6) 

 

2) A clinical endpoint bioequivalence study, with demonstration of acceptable dose-
response for test and reference products to assure study sensitivity. At this time, 
the Agency has no recommendations regarding the clinical bioequivalence study 
design. 

 

3) A systemic exposure (pharmacokinetic) bioequivalence study. 

 

2. Testing Requirements for the Two Lower Strengths (0.5 mg/2 mL or 0.25 
mg/2 mL) Products: 




If the micronized budesonide (bulk drug) used in the lower strength product is the 
same as that used in the higher strength product, i.e., same particle size, PSD, 
polymorphic form, and shape, and the respective lower strength test and reference 
formulations are Q1 and Q2 the same, the Division of Bioequivalence (DB) 
recommends that the firm conduct the following tests for the lower strengths of the 
test product: 

 

Option A. In Vitro Bioequivalence Studies Alone: 

 

If the comparative drug particle and agglomerate PSD in the nebulized aerosol 
between the test and reference products for both the higher and lower strengths can be 
determined, the following in vitro testing should be sufficient to demonstrate the 
equivalence of the lower strengths: 

 

1) Documentation of bioequivalence of the higher strength product based on 
acceptable comparative in vitro data outlined above. 

 

2) Comparative drug particle and agglomerate PSD in the suspension (in the 
ampoule) between the respective lower strengths of the test and reference 
products: The PSD determination should be based on a validated method. 
Validation should demonstrate method sensitivity to drug particle size over the 
expected size range in the suspension. 

 

3) Comparative drug particle and agglomerate PSD in the nebulized aerosol between 
the respective lower strengths of the test and reference products: Recommended 
method for this test is the aerodynamic particle size distribution (APSD) of the 


nebulized aerosol based on Apparatus 5 (USP <601>) at a flow rate of 15 L/min 
through the Apparatus. We recommend the study be conducted based on USP 
<1601> using the Pari LC Plus Nebulizer/Pari Master compressor system. The 
amount of drug deposited on the induction port, the seven stages of the cascade 
impactor, and the sum of the back-up filter and micro-orifice collector (MOC) 
should be submitted. 

 

4) Comparative Unit Dose Content (UDC) of drug between the respective lower 
strengths of the test and reference products. 

 

5) Comparative Mean Nebulization Time (MNT) and Mean Delivered Dose (MDD): 
The test should be conducted at the mouthpiece (% nominal dose) at the labeled 
flow rate of 5.5 L/min through such time that mist is no longer coming out of the 
mouthpiece, between the respective lower strengths of the test and reference 
products. 

 

6) The Mean Delivered Dose (MDD) ratio of the higher to lower strength of the test 
product should be similar to that of the reference product. 

 

Option B. Combination of In Vitro and In Vivo Bioequivalence Studies: 

 

If the drug particle and agglomerate PSD in the nebulized aerosols of the higher and 
lower strengths of the test and reference products cannot be determined as described 
above, the following testing should be sufficient to demonstrate the equivalence of the 
lower strengths: 

 

1) Documentation of bioequivalence of the higher strength product based on 
acceptable comparative in-vivo and in-vitro data outlined in 1, option B. 

 

2) Comparative Unit Dose Content (UDC) of drug between the respective lower 
strengths of the test and reference products. 

 

3) Comparative Mean Nebulization Time (MNT) and Mean Delivered Dose (MDD) 
at the mouthpiece (% nominal dose) at the labeled flow rate of 5.5 L/min through 
such time that mist is no longer coming out of the mouthpiece, between the 
respective lower strengths of the test and reference products. 

 

4) The Mean Delivered Dose (MDD) ratio of the higher to lower strength of the test 
product should be similar to that of the reference product. 

 


3. Recommendations Related to the Batch Size Recommendation for In Vitro BE 
Studies: 

1) In vitro BE studies for Budesonide Inhalation Suspension should generally be 
performed on samples from each of three or more batches of the test product and 
three or more batches of the reference listed drug. 

 

2) The number of units per batch to be studied should not be fewer than 30 for each 
strength of the test and reference products (i.e., no fewer than 10 from each of 
three batches). 

 

4. Recommendations Related to the Number of Retention Samples of Test Article 
from the In Vivo and In Vitro BE Studies: 

According to 21 CFR 320.63, the applicant and the contract research organization “shall 
retain reserved samples for any test article and reference standard used in conducting an 
in vivo or in vitro bioequivalence study required for approval of the abbreviated 
application or supplemental application.” 

 

A. If the BE studies are conducted at one site, the number of BE retention samples for 
Budesonide Inhalation Suspension drug product is recommended as follows: 

 

At least 50 units for each batch of test and reference products, including placebos 
(if applicable), must be retained for BE studies for Budesonide Inhalation 
Suspension drug product, in line with the FDA draft Guidance for Industry 
“Bioavailability and Bioequivalence Studies for Nasal Aerosols and Nasal Sprays 
for Local Action (April 2003), for multi-unit nasal aerosols and nasal sprays 
delivering 30 or more actuations per canister or bottle. 

 

B. If the BE studies are conducted at multiple sites, the number of BE retention 
samples for Budesonide Inhalation Suspension drug product is recommended as 
follows: 

 

At least 50 units for each batch of test and reference products, including placebos 
(if applicable), with not less than 10 units per each batch per site, be retained for 
the BE studies. For instance, if a BE study is conducted at 6 sites, using 1 batch of 
the test and reference products, the total number of reserve samples to be retained 
for the test and reference products must be at least 60, with at least 10 units per 
each batch per site (10 units/batch/site X 1 batch/product X 6 sites = at least 60 
units/product).

and U terms in the calculation. For data collected on more than one stage (m=2), use the 
equations listed above. 

 

The method of obtaining the upper confidence bound is based on two FDA guidances: 1) 
Statistical Information from the June 1999 Draft Guidance and Statistical Information for 
In Vitro Bioequivalence Posted on August 18, 1999, accompanying to Draft Guidance for 
Industry: Bioavailability and Bioequivalence Studies for Nasal Aerosols and Nasal 
Sprays for Local Action (April 2003); and 2) Guidance for Industry: Statistical 
Approaches to Establishing Bioequivalence (Jan. 2001). The concept is adapted from the 
method for the two-sequence, four-period study design using T-distribution. 

 

Step 5. For the test product to be bioequivalent to the reference product, the 
following condition must be satisfied: 

The 95% upper confidence bound for linearlized criteria H. must be = 0. 

 

 

 

 

 


B. An Example of PBE Computation: 

 

Study Design: The data given in this example are simulated. A parallel design with two 
products (test or reference) including 3 batches and 10 bottles/containers per batch for 
each product with three life stages (beginning, middle and end).

sR = algebraic expression
mMSWmmMSBRR)1(-
+= algebraic expression
163727878.0= 0.4046 > 0.1 (regulatory constant), 
therefore, reference-scaled procedure applies. 

 

Since the 95% upper confidence bound for linearized criteria of reference-scaled 
procedure is negative (-0.031498721), bioequivalence can be concluded. 

 

C. Electronic Table Templates for BE Study Data 

 

The following table templates have been developed in a concise format consistent with 
the Common Technical Document (CTD). For electronic submission of the individual 
data and summary data from the BE studies, please provide complete tables using the 


formats indicated below, and send them as a part of the ANDA bioequivalence 
submission. Submission of these electronic summary tables is necessary for improving 
the efficiency of the review process.
