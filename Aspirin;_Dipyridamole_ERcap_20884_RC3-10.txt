Dissolution test method and sampling times: 

Please note that a Dissolution Methods Database is available to the public at the OGD website 
at http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/dissolution/. Please find the dissolution 
information for this product at this website. Please conduct comparative dissolution testing on 
12 dosage units each of the test and reference products. Specifications will be determined upon 
review of the application. 

 

In addition to the method above, for modified release products, dissolution profiles on 12 dosage 
units each of test and reference products generated using USP Apparatus I at 100 rpm and/or 
Apparatus II at 50 rpm in at least three dissolution media (pH 1.2, 4.5 and 6.8 buffer) should be 
submitted in the application. Agitation speeds may have to be increased if appropriate. It is 
acceptable to add a small amount of surfactant, if necessary. Please include early sampling times 
of 1, 2, and 4 hours and continue every 2 hours until at least 80% of the drug is released, to 
provide assurance against premature release of drug (dose dumping) from the formulation. 
Specifications will be determined upon review of the data submitted in the application.
